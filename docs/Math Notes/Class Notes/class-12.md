# Lesson 12
## Class Overview
- C2S2P1YT
- C2S2P2
- C2S3P1
- Exam 1 next class. No homework!

## C2S2P1YT
- $$y_1, x_1, y_2, & x_2$$ Do not matter which order of points you use to find the #ARC just keep it consistent for $$x$$ **and** $$y$$.

## C2S2P2
- #Interpret-Yint-Slope y-intercept and slope in English.
  - Y-int : *When [x value] is 0, [y value] is [y-intercept]*
  - Slope : *When [x value] increases by 1, [y value] [increases|decreases] by [slope]*

## C2S3P1
- Writing #Point-Slope-Form and #Slope-Intercept-Form and converting between them.
- Careful with signs when distributing in parenthesis.

## Exam Review
- Solving equations w/ fractions
  - Use #Eliminate-Fractions
- Square roots/cube roots
  - Remember #Even-Odd-Root #Pos-Neg-Root
  - When solving for a variable, +-, when plain number it's only positive
- Domain/Range
  - Remember #Domain is x-values, #Range is y-values
  - #Set-Builder-Notation *or* #Interval-Notation
- #Function
  - Use #VerticalLineTest
  - Every input has one output
- Independant/Dependant variables.
  - #Function-Variables lone variable is *dependant*, other is *independant*.
- Solving for variables
- #Average-Rate-Of-Change
- #Net-Change
- #Function-Notation important
- Plotting #Piecewise-Defined-Function
- Story problems are present in the exam
