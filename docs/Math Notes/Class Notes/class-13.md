## C2S3P2
- Writing and interpreting linear functions.
  - Label the y-intercept, draw a line (roughly following the slope) and then draw a slope triangle and label according to +1 in x, +m in y.

## C5S1Activity
- Parabolas  
  - For $$x^2 + c$$, a change in *c** changes the location of the vertex of the parabola along the y-axis.  
  - For $$(x + b)^2$$, a change in *b* moves the parabola along the x-axis, however a positive increase in *b* moves the parabola in the **negative** direction, and a negative increase in *b* moves the parabola in the **positive** direction.  
  - For $$ax^2$$, a change in *a* changes the steepness of the parabola, alternatively *a* is equal to $$f(x)$$ when $$x$$ is 1 unit away from the vertex.
