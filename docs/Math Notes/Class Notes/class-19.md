# Lesson 19
## Class Overview
- C5S4P2E3
- C5S4P3
- C6S3YT
- Rational Equations P1
- Quiz Wednesday covering C5S3P2 + C5S4
- Michael will be hone Friday (still have class with sub)

## C5S4P2E3
- Don't enter negatives with exponents wrong, make sure it's like $$(-37)^2$$ on your calculator.

## C5S4P3
- #Discriminant is the section of the quadratic formula underneath the square root, if the discriminant is positive then there are two x-intercepts, if it is 0 then there is one x-intercept, and if it is negative there are no real solutions. $$D = b^2-4ac$$

## C6S3YT
- #Graping-Polynomial is based on the #Polynomial-Degree and the #Leading-Coefficient. If the LC is positive, both ends want to open up, if the Degree is odd it will swap the left opening.
  - Degree is even :
    - Leading Coefficient is positive : Both ends open up.
    - Leading Coefficient is negative : Left end is flipped, opens down.
  - Degree is odd :
    - Leading Coefficient is positive : Both ends open down.
    - Leading Coefficient is negative : Left end is flipped, opens up.

## Rational Equations P1
- Expression has no equal sign, equation has one.

## Ending
