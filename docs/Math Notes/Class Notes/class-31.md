## C4S6P1AYT
- #Compositional-Functions using a function output within a second function, eg. if $$f(x)=x-2$$ and $$g(x)=x^2$$, then $$g(f(x))=(x^2)-2$$.
- For #Compositional-Functions solve from the inside out, one function at a time. You can reverse-engineer the formula for the entire question but it will just take more time.

## C4S6P1B
- Finding #Compositional-Functions using a graph. Pretty self-explanatory hopefully. See pg. 167 in the structured notes for an example.

## C4S6P2YT
- #Inverse-Function practice, reading from a T-Chart and a Graph. Again not really possible to explain further, pg. 171 for example.

## C4S6P3
- #One-To-One every input has a unique output and every output has a unique input, if the #Inverse-Function of a #Function passes the #Horizontal-Line-Test then the function is one-to-one.
- #Horizontal-Line-Test if *no* horizontal lines drawn through a graph intersect the graph more than once, then the function is #One-To-One.
