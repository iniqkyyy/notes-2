## C4S4P2YT
- #Instantaneous-Percent-Growth is $$r$$ in $$Ce^{rt}$$. Different from $$r$$ in $$Ca^t$$ where $$a=1+r$$.

## C4S5YT
- #Solving-Variable-In-Exponent move everything away from the exponent, then take the log of both sides with the same base, to cancel the base and get the exponent. $$5e^{3x}=92 \; \to \; e^{3x}=\frac{92}{5} \; \to \; 3x=\ln{\frac{92}{5}}$$
