# Chapter 1 Section 5 Part 1
- Function notation.
    - equation representing function e.g $$y = x^2 + 4$$
    - x is input, y is output
    - replace y with $$f(x)$$
        - f is the name of the function
        - x is the input
        - to the right is a rule of handling outputs
        - e.g $$f(x) = x^2 + 4$$
- The input variable does not matter, but the rules must be the same!
    

## Vocabulary
- #Function is a "Rule" that assigns an output to a given input.
- #Function-Notation $$f(x)$$ will **never** be multiplication. Say "f of x".
