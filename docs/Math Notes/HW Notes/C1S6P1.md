# Chapter 1 Section 6 Part 1
- Graphing piecewise defined functions will have a boundary that separates two different lines (functions).
    - One line will have an "open" dot indicating it starts **after** that x value, and the other will have a closed dot indicating it starts **at** that x value.

## Vocabulary
- #Six-Basic-Functions
    - Constant Function, horizontal line ex. $$f(x) = 3$$
    - Identity Function, diagonal line ex. $$f(x)=x$$
    - Square Function, "U" shape ex. $$f(x)=x^2$$
    - Cube Function, "N" shape (negative input = exponential negative output, positive input = exponential positive output) ex. $$f(x)=x^3$$
    - Absolute Value Function, "V" shape ex. $$f(x)=|x|$$
    - Square Root Function, gentle curve, starting at 0 #Pos-Neg-Root ex. $$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$$
