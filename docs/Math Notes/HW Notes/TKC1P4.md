# Toolkit Chapter 1 Part 4
- If <u>every</u> vertical line intersects a graph at most <u>once</u>, then the graph *DOES* represent a function.
- However, if <u>any</u> vertical line intersects a graph <u>more</u> than once, then the graph does *NOT* represent a function.

## Vocabulary
- #Function is the relation of an input/output pair where every input has a single unique output.
- #VerticalLineTest If a vertical line on a graph crosses two data points, the data points are not a result of the function.
