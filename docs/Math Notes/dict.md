# Math Dictionary
## Roots
* #Even-Odd-Root even roots cannot be negative (not real), odds can be.
* #Pos-Neg-Root when solving roots 
$$\begin{cases} \sqrt[n]{x} = |x| & \text{if} & x \to \text{even} \\ \sqrt[n]{x} = x & \text{if} & x \to \text{odd}\end{cases}$$

## Notation
* #Interpret-In-English Always include input title, output title, use a word to describe the change in value ex. (increased, decreased)
* #Union The symbol for to unionize two sets is : 
"$$\cup$$"
for example : 
$$(1,3)\cup(5,7)$$ 
* #Interval-Notation Method to show inequality (for domains, etc.). Square bracket shows "inclusive", parenthesis shows "exclusive" and infinities always get parenthesis, ex.
$$(1\leq x\lt \infty)\to[1, \infty)$$ 

## Graphing
* #Relation is the *input/output* or *mapping* of a graph, ex. 
$$\{(2,3), (3, 4), (5,6)\}$$  
* #Domain is the set of all *input* values, ex. 
$$\{2, 3, 5\}$$  
* #Range is the set of all *output* values, ex. 
$$\{3, 4, 6\}$$  
* #Function is the relation of an input/output pair where every input has a single unique output. Also a "Rule" that assigns an output to a given input.
* #VerticalLineTest If a vertical line on a graph crosses two data points, the data points are not a result of the function.
* #Function-Variables Output is always a function of Input, Output (y) is dependant, Input (x) is *in*dependant.
* #Function-Notation 
$$f(x) \; \text{will **never** be multiplication. Say "f of x".}$$
* #Net-Change Is the change in output between two inputs, subtracting the second value from the first.
* #Set-Builder-Notation to define sets using special characters, ex. 
$$\{x|;x \leq 6,x\neq3\}$$  
* #Piecewise-Defined-Function is a way of describing functions using rules, for example :  
$$f(x)=\begin{cases} x^2 & \text{if} &x<1 \\ x + 1 &\text{if}&x\geq 1\end{cases}$$
* #Six-Basic-Functions
    * Constant Function, horizontal line ex. 
    $$f(x) = 3$$  
    * Identity Function, diagonal line ex. 
    $$f(x)=x$$  
    * Square Function, "U" shape ex. 
    $$f(x)=x^2$$  
    * Cube Function, "S" shape (negative input = exponential negative output, positive input = exponential positive output) ex. $$f(x)=x^3$$  
    * Absolute Value Function, "V" shape ex. 
    $$f(x)=|x|$$  
    * Square Root Function, gentle curve, starting at 0 #Pos-Neg-Root ex. 
    $$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$$  
* #Average-Rate-Of-Change or #ARC describes how *quickly* the function increases or decreases over an interval. Also shown as the slope between two points. e.g: 
$$\large\newline\frac{\text{net change in y}}{\text{change in x}}= \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
* #Secant-Line is the #Average-Rate-Of-Change in an interval. Draw a triangle showing rise/run in the interval and the hypotenuse will be the secant line.
* #Linear-Function are functions with a *constant* (not average) Rate of Change. A line on a graph.
* #Point-Slope-Form is the equation behind a #Linear-Function given a point on the line and the slope of the line. $$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\;\text{where the point is}\;(x_1, y_1)\;\text{and the slope is}\;m$$
* #Slope-Intercept-Form is the equation behind a #Linear-Function given the slope and y-intercept of the line. $$y=mx+b$$ where $$m$$ is the slope and $$b$$ is the y-intercept.
* #Interpret-Yint-Slope y-intercept and slope in English.
  * Y-int : *When [x value] is 0, [y value] is [y-intercept]*

  * Slope : *When [x value] increases by 1, [y value] [increases|decreases] by [slope]*

* #Horizontal-Vertical-Line the function to show a Horizontal line is $$x = a$$ and a Vertical line is $$y = b$$.
