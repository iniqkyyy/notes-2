# Dictionary
## Roots
- #Even-Odd-Root even roots cannot be negative (not real), odds can be.
- #Pos-Neg-Root when solving roots $$\begin{cases} \sqrt[n]{x} = |x| & \text{if} & x \to \text{even} \\ \sqrt[n]{x} = x & \text{if} & x \to \text{odd}\end{cases}$$
## Graphing
- #Relation is the *input/output* or *mapping* of a graph, ex. $$\{(2,3), (3, 4), (5,6)\}$$.
- #Domain is the set of all *input* values, ex. $$\{2, 3, 5\}$$.
- #Range is the set of all *output* values, ex. $$\{3, 4, 6\}$$.
- #Function is the relation of an input/output pair where every input has a single unique output. Also a "Rule" that assigns an output to a given input.
- #Function-Variables Output is always a function of Input, Output (y) is dependant, Input (x) is *in*dependant.
- #Function-Notation $$f(x)$$ will **never** be multiplication. Say "f of x".
- #VerticalLineTest If a vertical line on a graph crosses two data points, the data points are not a result of the function.
- #Net-Change Is the change in output between two inputs, subtracting the second value from the first.
- #Interpret-In-English Always include input title, output title, use a word to describe the change in value ex. (increased, decreased)
- #Set-Builder-Notation to define sets using special characters, ex. $$\{x\pipe x \leq 6,x\neq3\}$$
- #Piecewise-Defined-Function is a way of describing functions using rules, for example : $$f(x)=\begin{cases} x^2 & \text{if} &x<1 \\ x + 1 &\text{if}&x\geq 1\end{cases}$$
- #Six-Basic-Functions
    - Constant Function, horizontal line ex. $$f(x) = 3$$
    - Identity Function, diagonal line ex. $$f(x)=x$$
    - Square Function, "U" shape ex. $$f(x)=x^2$$
    - Cube Function, "S" shape (negative input = exponential negative output, positive input = exponential positive output) ex. $$f(x)=x^3$$
    - Absolute Value Function, "V" shape ex. $$f(x)=|x|$$
    - Square Root Function, gentle curve, starting at 0 #Pos-Neg-Root ex. $$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$$
- #Interval-Notation Method to show inequality (for domains, etc.). Square bracket shows "inclusive", parenthesis shows "exclusive" and infinities always get parenthesis, ex. for $$1\leq x\lt \infty$$ is the same as $$[1, \infty)$$
- #Union The symbol for to unionize two sets is $$(1,3)\cup(5,7)$$
