- Nothing to learn just practice.

## C5S4P1YT
- Finding a quadratic equation based on x-intercepts and a point.
  - Using x-intercepts you can write the equation in factored form $$f(x)=a(x-m)(x-n)$$
  - Using the point given, replace $$f(x)$$ with the y value, and $$x$$ with the x value. Solve for a.
  - Once you have a, you can complete the equation in #Factored-Form
- Finding x- and y-intercepts of a quadratic in #General-Form
  - Remembering that $$c$$ in general form is the y value of the y-intercept.
  - x-intercepts do not have to exist, if in the quadratic formula part inside the radical is negative then the parabola does *not* connect with the x-axis and has no x-intercepts.
- Graphing without x-intercepts.
  - You can use the y-intercept found earlier, the vertex, and the $$a$$ value to graph the parabola.
  - Plot them all and connect with curve, obviously vertex and the vertex point.
