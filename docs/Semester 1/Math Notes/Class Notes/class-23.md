- Rational Functions Summary

- C6S6P3E34
- Pre-Exam Quiz on Wednesday
- Exam is in parts on next Monday **and** Wednesday

## Rational Functions Summary
- Re-iterating over #Solving-Horizonal-Asymptotes , #Solving-Vertical-Asymptotes , #Polynomial-X-Intercepts , #Polynomial-Y-Intercepts

## C6S6P2YT
- #Reverse-Engineering-Rational-Functions use the x-intercepts, y-intercepts, and vertical/horizontal asymptotes to create a fraction function.
  - x-intercept = subtracted from numerator
  - vertical asymptote = denominator equal to 0 when $$x = $$ VA
  - horizontal asymptote = numerator/denominator degrees follow #Solving-Horizonal-Asymptotes
  - y-intercept = check if current function adheres to #Polynomial-Y-Intercepts, if not then add constant after fraction.
