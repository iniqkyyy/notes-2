# Chapter 2 Section 1 Part 1
- Secant line is just the slope between two points on a graph.
- #Average-Rate-Of-Change is very important!

## Vocabulary
- #Average-Rate-Of-Change describes how *quickly* the function increases or decreases over an interval. Also shown as the slope between two points. e.g: 
$$\frac{\text{net change in y}}{\text{change in x}}= \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
- #Secant-Line is the #Average-Rate-Of-Change in an interval. Draw a triangle showing rise/run in the interval and the hypotenuse will be the secant line.
