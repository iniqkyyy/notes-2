# Chapter 4 Section 2 & 4 Part 1

## Vocabulary
- #Natural-Exponential-Function the function of $$e^x$$ where $$e$$ is the irrational number. Crosses points $$(0,1)$$ & $$(1,e)$$.
- #Natural-Logarithm-Function the function of $$log_{e}(x)$$ where $$log_e$$ can be rewritten as $$ln$$. Crosses points $$(1,0)$$ & $$(e,1)$$.
- #Logarithm-Laws similar to #Relate-The-Bases logarithms can be moved when multiplication, addition or powers are in play.
  * Multiplication inside a logarithm is addition outside. eg. $$log_a(uv)=log_a(u)+log_a(v)$$
  * Division inside a logarithm is subtraction outside. eg. $$log_a(\frac{u}{v})=log_a(u)-log_a(v)$$
  * Exponentiation inside a logarithm is multiplication outside. eg. $$log_a(u^r)=r(log_a(u))$$
  * Log base anything of 1 is always 0. eg. $$log_a(1)=0$$
  * Log base $$a$$ of $$a$$ is always 1. eg. $$log_a(a)=1$$
