# Chapter 6 Section 6 Part 2
- Finding horitzonal asymptotes.

## Vocabulary
- #Solving-Horizonal-Asymptotes if the #Polynomial-Degree of the numerator is **equal to** the degree of the denominator, the Horizontal #Asymptote is equal to the ratio between the #Leading-Coefficient of the top and bottom polynomials. 
  - When the degree of the numerator is **less than** the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is at $$y=0$$.
  - When the degree of the numerator is **greater than** the degree of the denominator, there is *no* horizontal asymptote.
