# Toolkit Chapter 1 Part 3
- Square Root with no signs/numbers prior == principal root == positive solution only.
- Negative numbers cannot be even-rooted.
    - Only real numbers in this course.
    - Odd roots == can solve with negative numbers. #Even-Odd-Root #Pos-Neg-Root
- Split numbers in roots into factors to find squared numbers to cancel roots.
    - example : $$\large \sqrt {25} \to 25 = 5 * 5 \to \sqrt {5^2} = 5 \to \sqrt {25} = 5$$
- For any <u>positive</u> number $$a$$ : $$\large \sqrt[n] {a} = a$$
