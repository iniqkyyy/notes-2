- Quick Freewrite : what are you looking forward to?
  - I am really looking forward to going to college every day. While it is hard work, I have found that my thirst for knowledge is very strong and I am exstatic to learn. I have just received news that my first WRIT101 paper is already an A/A- and I haven't even reviewed it. My confidence is through the roof and I am  doing so well and I cannot wait to go into more classes that will interest me even more. I am also looking forward to playing more Sekiro with my friend Kaden, I've been having a ton of fun and I really enjoy when it's just us cause I think we vibe with eachother really well. I'm just all around having a really great day today and there's a lot I'm looking forward to but I'm also just happy in general. Kinda out of things to write about now! Just stalling for time! Look busy, be busy! Busy busy bee! Timer done woo!
