- A heartbreak that you've had.
  - I do not want to share the heartbreak that immediately comes to mind. I am filled with dread on a daily basis, my life feels like it falls to pieces and molds back into a disgusting amalgamation of what once somewhat resembled me and has since turned into a husk of inattention and despair. I want my life to be easy, fun, happy, exciting, hopeful. My life is hard and filled with heartbreak. I wish there wasn't ten different problems in any given day, I wish there was something I could do to live a normal, easy life. I want to be happy. There's always something wrong. The realization of how few things in my life go according to plan is enough to cause massive heartbreak. I am depressed and my life doesn't make it easier. I saw a psychologist talking about how male depression has skyrocketed and in turn suicide rates have gone through the roof. He explained that depression isn't the problem or the enemy, but their lives are genuinely not worth living. He talks about how young men today are realizing all of the things that are pushing them down and going poorly, he talks about how they have no friends to truly connect with and share their depression with. We have to stop now but I am sad.
