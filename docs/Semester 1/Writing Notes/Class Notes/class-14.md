- What can you not wait to do once you're out of college?
  - I just want money, financial struggles suck and all I truly want is to be comfortable in life. My enjoyment of life is drastically damaged by constant anxiety about money and managing it. I watch my partner go to work full-time and I cannot describe how horrible I feel knowing that their efforts will always be in vain, they'll never make enough money to be comfortable, I'll always have to say no when they ask for things, I'll always have to remind them about how much we owe on things like the credit cards. I can never just be content with where I am. I want to save money, I want to grow money, I want a retirement fund, I want to be able to plan trips and dates, I want to be able to live on my own. College is the catalyst for so much of my life, without it there is no way to live in our current society. I am immensely dissatisfied with the direction I have taken my life and I resent myself for setting the stage how I have.
