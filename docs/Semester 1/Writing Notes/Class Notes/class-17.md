- prompt: what was the happiest day of your life so far?
  - I'm not certain that I have a happiest day of my life, I consider that my experiences have ranged from 10-70% happiness and I have not experienced rock bottom or total elation. I suppose that a happy day in my recent life is getting into college and starting my journey of self-improvement. Moving upwards through the world, having the possibility of making enough money to live comfortably. A happy day in memory is announcing that my partner, Silas, was moving in with me after 4 years of a long distance relationship. A happy day in childhood was spending time with my friends, no particular day in general but the enjoyment of having physical friends around me that I felt comfortable with. This is something I no longer have and is something I reminisce about on occassion. Happy-est days aren't something to dwell on, in my opinion, when you re-live a positive experience you're "stealing" happiness from it. The memory fades as you reignite the feeling you once had, it gets duller every time you retell the story. I look towards the future with hope, or at least try to, in an attempt to always stay content without fluctuating emotions.
