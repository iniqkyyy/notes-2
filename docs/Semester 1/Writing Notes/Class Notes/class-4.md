# Lesson 4

## Class Overview
- Cont. of last class [[Writing Notes/Class Notes/class-3.md]].
    - Change in language based on formality, like a spectrum from texting your best friend to tea with the royal family.
    - Rikka is the target audience. My desired result is to pass this class.
        - on the previously mentioned scale: around a 6/7 out of 10
        - Why not a 10?
            - Lose personality on the upper end of formality.
    - Don't be boring??

## Daily Freewrite 
- The last time you laughed really hard. Really I laugh extremely hard any time I hang out with my friend Tom. I can't exactly pinpoint one experience that stands out, I honestly have more fun than you could expect every time I get to spend time with him. Tom has had a really rough life and I worry about him, I cherish every day I get with him and I worry about his future. His life is, however, moving up and a lot of positive changes have happened for him recently. He moved across the country to his brother after being kicked out of his apartment complex, he now lives with them in a rent-free house until he gets back on his feet. This includes no longer working 12 hour shifts at a Walmart warehouse and instead finding work that he can manage. He's been on some pretty hard pills for a long time taking them daily for his anxiety because of how hard his life has been. I'm really excited for this chapter of his life to begin to unfold because I believe he can finally breathe after many years of suffocating.

## Rhetorical Analysis
- Not looking at your writing, not concerned with writing.
    - Concerned with how well you read. Observation and Analysis.
    - #Important Be a good reader to be a good writer.
- Questions
    - Who is the target audience
    - What's the desired outcome
        - What does she want the audience to think, feel, or do?
    - #Important Note to self: maybe talk more about what Siu wants the audience to do.

## Topic2
- 

## Ending
- Two branches every author needs to be taken seriously
    - Intellectual credibility: we don't listen to people we deem "dumb". ***again with the "don't be dumb"??***
    - Cultural credibility: audience wants to know you share the same values and interests.
- Questions to address again during paper:
    - Who is the target audience?
    - What is the writer trying to make the audience think/feel/do?
- Grammar corner
    - every day vs. everyday
    - this is what i'm learning in college?? what the fuck.
