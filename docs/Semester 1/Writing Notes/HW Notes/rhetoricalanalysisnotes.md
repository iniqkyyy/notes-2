# I Made Video Games and I Don't Want My Children Playing Them
- This opinion piece about the pitfalls of gaming addiction and corporate greed reads like a concerned parent who heeds a warning to others like him.
- Using laws being created in adjacent fields as an entrance point, and giving example from China, William is attempting to *really* sell the narrative of video games being extremely disruptive to adolescent development.
- Using his background in game development, William is attempting to use his credibility to shine light on how fine-tuned these video games are to develop unhealthy habits and stunt growth all for a profit.
- Going as far to explain exactly how he described this addiction-feeding with his engeineering team, using an easy to understand analogy of cake, he's very clearly distressed about the state of the gaming industry and wants to help parents keep their kids from being affected.
- He explains the lightbulb moment when his daughters were growing older and showing interest in these horrible games that he created.
- Targeting an older audience he is using easy to understand analogies and direct sources of the World Health Organization.
- He is fully targeting parents or soon-to-be parents and not even the game industry at all, wanting parents to fully control their child's exposure to games.
- He doesn't seem worried about games or technology in general, but that parents are nowhere near as concerned about gaming as they should be.
