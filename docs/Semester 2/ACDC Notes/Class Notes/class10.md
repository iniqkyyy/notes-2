## Class
- Chapter 3
- Ohms Law
  - $$I=\frac{V}{R}$$ where $$I = $$ Current, $$V = $$ Voltage, and $$R = $$ Resistance.
- Watts Law
  - $$P=I^2$$, $$P=VI$$, $$P=\frac{V^2}{R}$$
  - $$P = $$ Watts
- Energy and Power
  - Work = Force (newton) * Distance (meter)
  - Work = Newton-meter or Joule, both the same name
  - Power (Joules per Second, or Watts) = Work (Joules) / time (seconds)
- Resistors convert power to heat
