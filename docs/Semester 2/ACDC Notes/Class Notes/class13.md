# ACDC Electronics Class 13
- come dressed up to class oct 30
- add voltages KVL law style in SERIES circuit
  - all voltage must be used
## Champter 4 cont.
- current in SERIES circuit is always constant
- voltage, resistance, and power in SERIES are always additive
- power supply in SERIES add voltage
- reversed power supply polarities subtracts voltage, 3 9V batteries with center reversed, total = 9V
- Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
  - The sum of all voltage drops around a single closed path in a circuit is equal to the total source voltage in that closed path.

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_1=0$$
