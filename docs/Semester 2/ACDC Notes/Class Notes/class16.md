# ACDC Electronics Class 16
- LAB 7 CANCELLED
- connected to two nodes (sharing nodes) it's a parallel circuit
- parallel circuits have more than one path for the current to follow.
- current at voltage source is always equal, a Total
- resistance total = reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the resistors i.e $$R_T=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}}=(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3})^{-1}$$
- the total resistance will always be less than or equal to the smallest resistor
- for TWO resistors only, total resistance can be expressed as $$R_T=\frac{\frac{R1}{R2}}{R1+R2}$$
- in paralell circuit, the voltage is always equal, the current is what changes
- ohm's law still works for parellel circuits $$V=IR$$.
- total current = sum of individual currents
- Kirchoff's current law KCL
  - sum of currents entering a node must also be the sum of currents exiting the node
