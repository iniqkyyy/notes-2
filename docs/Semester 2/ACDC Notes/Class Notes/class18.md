# ACDC Electronics Class 18
- 3 more labs
- after thanksgiving break only 2 classes then done
- chapter 6 today
- NEXT MONDAY NO CLASLS VET DAY
- final assignment due friday december 6th
## Series Parallel Circuits
- combine parallel resistors into one resistor, solve circuit as Series $$R_T=\text{R}_1+(\text{R}2\space||\space \text{R}3)$$
- [for example](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/combination-series-parallel-circuits.jpg?fit=400%2C282)
  - R1 and R8 as series with everything else, no change needed
  - R6 and R7 are in parallel with eachother, $$\text{R}_6\space||\space\text{R}_7$$
    - this is in series with R5 so add in series $$\text{R}_5 + \text{R}_6\space||\space\text{R}_7$$
  - R2 R3 and R4 are in series, so add $$\text{R}_2+\text{R}_3+\text{R}_4 = \text{R}_{234}$$
  - $\text{R}_{234}$ is in parallel with $\text{R}_5 + \text{R}_6\space||\space\text{R}_7$
    - $$(\text{R}_{234})\space||\space(\text{R}_5 + \text{R}_6\space||\space\text{R}_7)$$
  - add in series with R1 and R8
    - $$\text{R}_T=\text{R}_{18}+(\text{R}_{234}\space||\space(\text{R}_5 + (\text{R}_6\space||\space\text{R}_7)))$$
