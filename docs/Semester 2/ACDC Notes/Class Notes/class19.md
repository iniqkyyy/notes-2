# ACDC Electronics Class 19
- Thevenin's Theorem
  - easy testing single component
  - $$\text{V}_\text{TH}$$ thevenin voltage is voltage across the two nodes
  - $$\text{R}_\text{TH}$$ thevenin resistance is resistance of the circuit if the power supply was connected to the two nodes
  - replace voltage source with wire, place voltage source between nodes
- Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
  - to have the most power (Watts) in a series circuit with two resistors R1 and RL, R1 = RL ~ max Watts
- Superposition Theorem
  - with multiple voltage sources
  - leave one voltage source at a time, the rest are replaced (short for voltage source, infinity for current source)
  - determine the current or voltage that you want to find with that source
  - swap the sources
  - to find the actual current, sum your results
