# Lesson 2 AC/DC Electronics
- Composition Notebook
- Powerpoint is exactly what is taught in class
- Homework (due wed midnight, open prior to class), exam (due fri midnight), and lab reports (due 1wk after done) submit under D2L>Assignments
- First lab sept 9th
- No finals during finals week
## Chapter 1
- Units and Quantities
  - scientific/engineering notation will be i.e $$10^3$$
  - scientific is only 1 number to the left of decimal multiplied by a power of 10 i.e $$4.7 * 10^7$$
  - engineering notation is 1-3 digits to the left of decimal, exponent is divisible by 3, multiplied by a power of 10 i.e $$47 * 10^6$$
  - Addition/Subtraction
    - common exponent, add/subtract constant
    - $$(3*10^3)+(2.5*10^3)=5.5*10^3$$
  - Multiplication/Division
    - multiply/divide constant, add/subtract exponent
    - $$(4.3*10^6)(2*10^13)=8.6*10^19$$
  - On calculator hit *EE* button and it will create 10^X where X is the exponent (mine is shift + log)
