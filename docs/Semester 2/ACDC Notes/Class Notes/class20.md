# ACDC Electronics Class 20
- chapter 7, the magnetic field
- every force from a magnet always flows from north to south
- electric current is the source of magnetism
- magnetic force is called magnetic flux
  - unit of flux is weber denoted by $$\phi$$
    - determined by current, material, etc.
  - unit of flux density is the weber/sqrmeter = tesla
    - $$B=\frac{\phi}{A}$$
  - 1 Tesla = 10,000 Gauss
- Left hand rule, left thumb in direction of current, curve fingers in the direction of magnetic force
- Permeability
  - relative permeability is the ratio between absolute permeability over the permeability in vaccuum
  - $$\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0}$$
  - $$\mu_0=4\pi\text{E-7}$$
- reluctance
  - opposite to magnetic
  - A-t/Wb ampere-turns per weber
  - $$\mathcal{R}=\frac{L}{\mu A}$$
- magnetomotive force
  - $$F_m=NI$$
    - N number of turns of wire in coil
    - I is current
    - F is literally the force
- Ohm's Law for magnetic circuits
  - $$\phi=\frac{F_m}{\mathcal{R}}$$
  - flux is like current
  - magnetomotive force is like voltage
  - reluctance is similar to resistance
