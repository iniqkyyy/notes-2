## Chapter 2 Begin
- Atoms
- Periodic table will be used often
- electrons outside, proton and neutron inside, pro=pos charge + electrons = neg charge
- periodic number is how many protons your element has
- electrons orbit in shells, layers like an onion
- shells have $$2n^2$$ electrons, 1st layer = 2, 2nd layer = 8, 3rd layer = 18
- outer ring is called the valence shell, manipulate valence shell with low connectivity to atoms
- #Conductors have high current flow, used in wires, large number of free electrons, characterized by 1-3 valence electrons
- #Semiconductors are characterized by having exactly four valence electrons, Silicon, Boron, etc. can be manipulated to be an insulator or conductor.
- #Insulators have no free electrons, their valence electrons are bound to the atoms, does not allow electric current to pass through.
- atoms are trying to equalize their electrons to either a full shell or empty
- Charge = Q
- Equal charge repels, opposite charge attracts
- Coulomb's Law says that the force between charges is inversely proportional to the radius between electrons.
- Lightning is a previous connection of electrons from the clouds and ground.
- #Coulomb a coulomb $$C$$ is the total charge possessed by $$6.25x10^{18}$$ electrons. A single electron has a charge of $$e=1.6x10^{-19}$$. The total charge of someting is $$Q=\text{(# of Electrons)/}(6.25x10^{18}/C)$$
- Electric field atoms with arrows pointing away are pushing away, arrows pointing inwards are pulling in.
- Voltage is the force required to move a charge agaisnt the electric field.
- EMF = Voltage = Electric Potential
- #Voltage is the equation $$V=\frac{W}{Q}$$ where $$W$$ = the energy in Joules and $$Q$$ = the charge in Coulombs (C).
- Voltage is the push or pressure applied to electrons. Like water pressure.
- All circular batteries have 1.5V
- Align batteries in Parallel (connect all pos and all neg to same side) will stay at 1.5V.
- Align batteries in Series (pos to neg ad infinitum) adds/subtracts 1.5V each time.
- Solar cell, light comes in through safety glass, reflects to stay in the system, then uses heat (light) to create Power
-
