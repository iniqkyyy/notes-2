# Lesson 7 AC/DC Electronics
- current is cuolomb
- electron flow is opposite current
- resistance is like a squiggly line, longer path to go through
- conductance is the reciprocal of resistance $$G=1/R$$
- resistance can limit current, divide voltage, generate heat/light 
- decode resistor:
  - first band is first digit
  - second band is the second digit
  - third band is multiplier
  - fourth band is percent tolerance (gold is +- 5% tolerance, silver is +- 10% tolerance)
