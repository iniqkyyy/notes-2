# Lesson 8 AC/DC Electronics
- last time tealked about resistors
- rarer variable resistors, screw on top that changes resistance
- used in microchips, seen in thermometers
- potentiometers are variable resistors, rheostats are similar
- wire resistance is assumed to be 0 for this class
- $$R=\frac{pl}{A}$$ where p is the resistivity in CM-Ohms/ft, l = length in feet, and A = cross sectional area in circular mils, or CMs.
- CM = thickness, larger wire has less resistivity, smaller wire has more.
- #Resistivity is the resistive value of a specific element, whereas resistance depends on length is a total amount.
- Basic Electric Circuit
  - a voltage sourcee
  - a path
  - a load (something that takes the power)
- electrons flow from neg to pos 
- Switches
  - the pole is the moveable arm of the switch
  - the throw is the number of contacts that are affected by the pole
  - SPST single pull single throw -/-
  - SPDT <-_
  - DPST both poles are connected and make a separate connection
  - DPDT both poles are connected and can both make two points of connections
- Ground
  - is the point in a circuit where we assume 0 voltage 
  - typically represented by three lines that look like an arrow
  - also can look like a cursive E or an empty arrow pointing nowhere
- Multimeter
  - voltmeter measures voltage
  - ammeter measures current
- Measuring Circuits
  - measuring current
    - the meter has to be installed in series with the power supply and resistor
    - circle with A inside means ammeter
  - measuring voltage
    - voltmeter must eb installed in parallel with the power supply and resistor
    - you must have a connection at both sides of your circuit or whatever you're measuring
    - circle with V inside means voltmeter
  - measuring resistance
    - can measure the resistance at any point, no circuit required
- review of material on Monday
- bring questiosn on monday, open homework prior
- monday is last class for a week, next class is the following wednesday
- homework2 due next wednesday (no class) exam2 due next friday
- next lab on next Monday
