# AD/DC Dictionary
### Terms
- #Coulomb a coulomb $$C$$ is the total charge possessed by $$6.25x10^{18}$$ electrons. A single electron has a charge of $$e=1.6x10^{-19}$$.
- #Conductors have high current flow, used in wires, large number of free electrons, characterized by 1-3 valence electrons
- #Semiconductors are characterized by having exactly four valence electrons, Silicon, Boron, etc. can be manipulated to be an insulator or conductor.
- #Insulators have no free electrons, their valence electrons are bound to the atoms, does not allow electric current to pass through.
- #Resistivity is the resistive value of a specific element, whereas resistance depends on length is a total amount.
- #Ground is the point in a circuit where the voltage is 0.
### Formulas
- #Voltage voltage is depicted by $$V=\frac{W}{Q}$$ where $$V$$ is Voltage in Volts, $$W$$ is Work (or energy) in Joules, and $$Q$$ is Charge in Coulombs.
- #Amperage amps are depicted by $$I=\frac{Q}{t}$$ where $$I$$ is Current in Amps, $$Q$$ is Charge in Coulombs, and $$t$$ is Time in Seconds.
- #Ohms-Law $$\text{V}=\frac{\text{I}}{\text{R}}$$ can be rewritten to solve for current or resistance.
- #Watts-Law $$\text{P}=\text{V}\text{I}$$ can be rewritten as $$\text{P}=\frac{\text{V}^2}{\text{R}}$$ and $$\text{P}=\text{I}^2\text{R}$$
- #Wire-Resistance $$R=\frac{pl}{A}$$ where $$p$$ is the Resistivity in Circular Mill Ohms per Foot, $$l$$ is Length in Feet, and $$A$$ is the cross sectional area in Circular Mills.
- #Conductance is the reciprocal of Resistance $$G=\frac{1}{R}$$ where $$G$$ is Conductance in Siemens, and $$R$$ is Resistance in Ohms.
- #Ohms-Law $$I=\frac{V}{R}$$ where $$I = $$ Current, $$V = $$ Voltage, and $$R = $$ Resistance.
