# Photonics Lesson 10
## Logarithms
- richter scale measures earthquake magnitude, log base 10.
  - measurement is in peak seismic wave amplitude (peak of wave - equilibrium) 100km away from center of earthquake
- decibels
  - 10log(I/I0)
  - 10^-13 watts per meter squared = 0dB
- optical density
  - OD=-log(I/I0) where I is a measurement of light intensity
  - glasses act as light attenuator, attenuate = reduce, diminish
- light intensity is how power is distributed across an area, Watts per Area squared, or Joules over Time squared Area squared
- Beer's Law
  - when send light into material it will attenuate it as it transfers through material, intensity will dimishing as a function of how far it has traveneled through the material
  - $I=I_0(e^{\alpha l})$ where $$\alpha$$ = the absorption coefficient of the material, $$I$$ is the light intensity prior to and after traveling through the materia, and $$l$$ is the length of the material.
