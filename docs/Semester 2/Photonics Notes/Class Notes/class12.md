# Photonics Lesson 12
- electromagnetic waves (light) have energy, they can do work
- photovoltaic (pv)
  - shine light on material, electrons are ejected
- radio waves (light) can push electrons out of a wire (antenna) and we can use that to transfer information
- trasnfer from an optical medium to an electronic medium
- light waves (rules of electromagnetism)
  - whenever a charged particle accelerates (change in velocity), it creates an electromagnetic wave (an EM wave is emitted)
  - to make a radio wave, take an antenna and send charged particles out in some motion to create an EM wave
- in an atom, electrons "orbit" a nucleus, but they do *not* emit light waves and do not lose energy
- Intensity is how power is distributed over an area $$I=\frac{P}{A}$$ where $$P = $$ Power (watts) and $$A = $$ Area (square meters).
- lasers are a single wavelength of light, columated
  - high "peak" power, can be engineeered to release a lot of energy in a *very* small time (<1ns)
- wave and wave attributes
  - a particle's position in meters will oscillate over time
  - an entire medium wil move in the same oscillating motion through space
  - time through one cycle is a period (T)
  - number of cycles in one second is the frequency (1/T)
  - distance a wave travels in one period = $$\lambda$$
  - the velocity is $$V=f\lambda$$ where $$f$$ is the frequency and $$\lambda$$ is the wavelength.
  - wave is energy and momentum transfer
  - the end of where a wave disturbance travels is a "barrier" (also interface, something changing from one medium to another)
    - if a barrier is not fixed, free to move, the disturbance will reflect the disturbance back
    - fixed barrier = medium connecting to barrier cannot move
    - if a barrier is fixed, the disturbance will reflect in the opposite manner, flipped along the x axis, inverted
  - amplitude is the local max/min of a wave relative to 0 in meters
  - light acts the same, it hits a barrier and its "phase" either reflects or inverts
  - when two disturbances meet they create a combined pulse and continue in their own directions
    - disturbances co-exist
    - when disturbances overlap, it's called "interference"
    - when overlap occurs and the medium changes by more than either wave's amplitude but less than their sum, these are "regions of *constructive* interference"
    - when overlap occurs and the waves overlap perfectly (same direction), this is "*perfectly* constructed interference"
    - when overlap occurs and the medium changes by less than both wave's amplitude but more than 0, these are "regions of *destructive* interference"
    - when overlap occurs and the peak of one wave and the valley of the other perfectly cancel eachother out, this is "*perfectly* destructed interference"
  - when two waves overlap this is "superposition" which is another word for "region of interference"
  - when multiple forces overlap and act on the same point in space, they are superposing on eachother, they are in superpostion
- "AM" = amplitude modulation, voice is high frequency, being moved by low frequency "carrier waves", superimpose them on top of eachother
  - modulating the carrier wave with the voice wave allows it to maintain distance while carrying high frequency
- "FM" = frequency modulation?
- charged particle creates an electric field around
