# Photonics Lesson 13
- make laser next year
- Resonance
  - systems want to oscillate at a natural frequency
  - if a system is forced at a natural frequency it will gain energy
  - if not forced at a natural frequency, energy of the oscillator will tend to dissipate
- when kid on swing is tapped at apex of swing it is "resonating"
- wire with waves running through it, only some frequencies will persist, rest dissipate
  - resonant frequency, resonant wavelengths
  - resonance is achieved with nodes at the end of the length L $$L=\lambda x$$ where $$x$$ is a whole number ($$\lambda$$ is the wavelength).
  - resonant frequency waves create standing waves (harmonics)
    - that is to say the medium will move but you cant see the interference moving
- wave points where the medium is unmoving (in equilibrium, at zero point) = nodes
- wave points of min/max amplitudes = anti nodes
- laser contains resonant cavity
- line of wave is a "wavefront"
- velocity of wave = frequency times wavelength
