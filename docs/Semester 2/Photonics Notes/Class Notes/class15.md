# Photonics Lesson 15
- these slides online
- when a charged particle accelerates as part of an oscillatory motion, it emits ripples, or oscillations, in its electric field, which also produces a magnetic wave (Maxwell)
- A and B fields (electric, magnetic) are self-perpetuating
  - a change in one produces a change in the other
- light is also created by electron transitions (saved for later, light as particle talk)
- EM waves do NOT require a medium to propagate, they can move through the vacuum of space
- michelson-morley experiment 1885, biggest first experiment that showed no aether
- throw ball from truck, person in truck sees 10m/s, person on side of road sees 110m/s
- invarience of the speed of light, independant from the frame of reference of the observer
  - length dialation and time dialation are the only solution to the speed of light being constant
- electromagnetic spectrum
  - light from sun is a superposition, a stew, of waves of different frequency
  - long wavelength = low energy, low frequency
  - short wavelength = high energy, high frequency
  - frequencies
  - 10^4-10^6 = raido waves
  - 10^6-10^12 = micro waves
  - 1^12-10^15 = visible and infrared
  - 10^16-10^18 = ultraviolet
  - 10^18-10^20 = x-ray
  - 10^20+ = gamma ray
  - infrared = BELOW red
  - ultraviolet = ABOVE violet
  - visible light
    - low energy side/low frequency side 750nm
    - high energy side/high frequency side 450nm
  - lowest energy light waves (radio waves) can be 30000m of wavelength
  - x rays just make an image of a shadow
  - gamma rays interacting with certain nuclei, antiparticles can be created
    - an electron interacting with a gamma ray can transform into a different particle called a positron
  - energy ability to do work
  - energy is stored and trasnferred by way of EM radiation
  - power is the rate of energy transfer, energy/second
  - intensity, or irradiance, is POWER per AREA
  - (radiance, irradiance, intensity, small differences to this, but for this class we will be ignoring them)
  - light manifests as a wave but shows particle behavior
  - intensity of the light, is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the E-field 
  - polarization describes the directions in which an E-field vector "points" as a wave propagates.
  - helical wave, circular polarization
  - imaging of light at a particular wavelength that has different polarizations
  - different things that bounce light will change the polarization
  #### distance amplitude of light is unchanging, but what is it?
  #### min/max limit of light frequency? anything above or below radio/gamma?
