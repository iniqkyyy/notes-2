# Photonics Lesson 17
- voltage is "the height of an electrical hill".
  - $$U$$ is a variable for potential energy
  - water at top of waterfall has potential energy $$U=mgh$$
  - the height of a gravitational hill is analogous to voltage in an electrical circuit
  - charge a metal plate with a lot of positive or negative net charge and you've created a a large electrical hill
  - the charge of the plate *creates* the voltage
  - place a positive particle a physical distance away from a negatively charged plate and you have given it electric potential energy
- electricity isn't scary because of high voltage or high current, it's scary because of the POWER it can exert
- $$\text{eV}$$ is the electron-Volt, quite literally the energy an electron has at one volt $$U_E={q_e}{V}=1.6\text{E-}19$$
### Laser Safety
- find document online
- required to do this
- must complete training Laser Safety Course (ID 19819)
- email e-certificate to Mark
- lasers are monochromatic, one frequency
- lasers are usually collimated, narrow radiation spread
- lasers are coherent, crests and troughs are all overlapping with like waves
- LASER = Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
  - radiation meaning similar to Light
- light is dangerous due to frequency, not brightness
- direct exposure: direct contact to light with eyeball
- specular reflection exposure: reflected on flat surface directly into eye
- diffuse reflection exposure: light diffused
- Nominal Hazard Zone
  - region where there is direct, reflected, or scattered light that is above a threshhold of maximum permissibility exposure (MPE)
  - zone depends on whether or not the beam is direct, diverging, converging, or diffuse.
- MPE is expressed in terms of the allowable exposure time for a given irradiance (power per area)
- UV-C, UV-B (100nm-315nm) radiation is preferrentially absorbed into the cornea
- same goes for IR-B, IR-C (1400nm-1mm)
- UV-A is (315-400nm) preferrentially absorbed into the lens
- same goes for selected wavelengths (700-3000nm)
- IR-A (400nm-1400nm) more effectively transmits through your eye into your retina
- find graph and save, skin penetration of radiation
- proton tumor oblation
- Class 1 and 1M lasers cannot cause damage typically
- Class 2 usually blink response is fine
  - Class 2M can be hazardous with enhancement devices
- Class 3R lasers are typically not harmful but do not look into it
- Class 4 lasers are capable of causing injury to eye and skin as well as being dangerous even diffusely reflected
- most laser pointers are around class 2, but green ones are class 3 so dont look at them
- irradiance = intensity for OUR purposes.
