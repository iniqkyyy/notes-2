# Photonics Lesson 2
## Part 1
- Math/Units/Dimensional Analysis/Graphing will be covered at beginning as refresher
- Scientific notation, engineering notation
  - view [[docs/Semester 2/ACDC Notes/Class Notes/class2]]
- speed of light = c = 300,000,000m/s = 3E8m/s = 3*10^8m/s
- all non-zeros are significant figures, something like 7000 has only one significant digit (7) but 59.63 has four (all of them), zeroes are significant if they are between non-zeroes as you are already proving your resolution to be deeper than where the zero is located
- more precision is nonsense, 9.38721689 is just a better measurement of 9.387 which is a better measurement of 9
- when multiplying/dividing you can't be more accurate than the least precise input
