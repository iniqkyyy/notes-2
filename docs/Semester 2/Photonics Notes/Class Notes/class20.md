# Photonics Lesson 20
- ADVR
- engineered materials
- electro-magnetics
  - mix optical fields with RF fields and encode with RF signals
- optical source, RF signal generator
  - both electro-magnetic waves
- almost no loss in fiber optic cable
- ADVR works in visible light, their niche
- couple the fields in visible and radio waves
- ferroelectic, lithium niabate
- thin layer lithium niabate, regular high capacitance, etc.
- free space radio waves = free space laser
- fiber optic cable = telephone cable
- electro-optic modulator manipulates optical EM waves with RF EM waves
- voltage over crystal makes the light moving through modulates the phase or intensity
- intensity modulation = smaller amplitude when at valley of RF wave, higher amplitude when at peak of RF wave
- phase modulation = higher frequency at peak, lower frequency at valley
- DWMD CBAND telecom system, 40GHz band spacing WDM
- applications
  - fiber optic communication
  - interferometric, moving reflection of waves in and out of phase
    - flatness, shine laser down and measure the phase return
  - spectroscopic measurement
    - things we detect in the air absorb or reflect very specific wavelengths
  - wavelength tuning and locking, mode locking lasers
- turn RF into varying voltage, apply voltage across two gold bars, waveguide changes index of refraction in reaction 
- effecting the light a very small amount thousands of times compounds into a full phase shift of the light
- going from single band laser, adding a side band frequency that cancels out but can be extracted at the endpoint
- mock zender interferometer
  - take a laser beam, split into two, encode RF signal onto one side using phase modulation
  - recombine split beams, creating an oscillating constructive or destructive interference in the endpoint (blinking)
- ADVR makes EOMs that create large phase shifts for low voltage
- $$\deltaOline=\frac{\pi}{\lambda}n^3r(V(\frac{L}{d})-*)$$
  - wavelength lambda
  - numerical index of materials n
  - electro-optic coefficient r 
  - applied voltage V 
  - length of interaction L 
  - interaction cross section d 
  - losses * 
- CAN control L d *
  - big L
    - limited by rf and optical waveguide losses, and substrate 
  - small d 
    - limited by fab constraints 
  - minimize *
    - rf and optical losses both degrade, rf MORE
- AdvR makes devices that combine RF into optical
- limit impedance by not creating reflection by keeping resistance similar
- high speed RF packaging
  - even slight change in impedance leads to massive shifts in phase shift 
  - moving from coaxial to coplanar
- tools used 
  - soldering station
    - need pins exactly placed, can break entire device
  - microelectronic pick and place tool 
    - vaccuum picks up, warms, solder
  - hyper sonic wire bonder 
    - takes gold, welds between the boards in the package
  - vector network analylzer 
    - detects frequency of RF wave entering and reflecting
    - very finnicky
    - multiple ports allows diagnosing not only problem, but location
- fiber optic cables
  - lasers have different connector types, need to have the right connector
  - fiber, industry standard multi-mode, performance varies widely per application
    - 30c to 20$ to move from amplification to polarization fiber cables
  - strain relief boot, limits sharp bending of fiber optic
  - fiber capillary, polished material to allow extraction of laser from cable 
  - about 0.3 micron grit
- waveguide modulator crystal (AdvR's expertise)
  - as noted above, substrates (KTP, LN, TFLN, MgO:LN)
  - optical waveguide types
    - ion exchange
      - kneeled proton exchange (put H+ in, get L+ out, polarizing)
      - titanium indiffusion (pattern with LN, cook at 1000C+, titanium oxidizes and embeds into LN which stresses and makes waveguide, non-polarizing)
    - ridge (diced with mech saw)
    - ridge (wet-etched, pattern and chemically etched (or ion etched))
    - combination of above, each benefit or detriment
  - RF waveguide types  
    - traveling wave 
      - try to keep speed of optical wave and rf wave equal down the waveguide
    - lumped element 
      - big capacitor, RF goes on, reflects back off, stops working past a few GHz
- fiber optic packaging 
  - limit reflection mismatch
  - angled substrate means light will not reflect back into laser (bad)
  - fibers are industry standard, known sizes, keep waveguide sizes equal to fiber sizes
  - optical waveguide fields
    - electric field has to exist outside the bounds of the waveguide
    - metal conductor cannot handle this, will create attenuation and ruin the waveguide by effectively shorting it
  - 5 axis fiber coupling station for fiber capillary, x y z pitch yaw
  - fiber coupled laser source
  - coupling optics
  - optical power meter 
  - as lambda gets shorter, the defects become more important, tolerance becomes smaller
- lower frequencies, longer device more efficient
- higher frequencies, smaller device more efficient
  - due to traveling wave, by end of longer device the index change is subtracting
- in a lab can use very short device to flatten Vpi curve for ease of use and less calibration
- atomic clock 
  - small diode laser split 
    - locking system and control loop
      - amplify pulse modulation 
      - second harmonic generation, splsitting frequency
      - enter three tones into rubidium cell (correct frequency)
      - turns into beat note signal onto photo detector
      - use RF filters with known frequency to frequency lock laser into VERY specific frequency
    - send locked laser into frequency comb
      - bunch of laser lines with different spacing
      - spacing and jitter
      - double frequency
      - take long end of comb, frequency double it to low end
      - beat detector with original comb to lock signal (stop spacing wiggle, still have jitter)
      - filter out middle wavelength, lock this with absolute frequency reference to stop jitter
      - take end frequency and count low frequency with computer and can read clock 
  - use this to read time change on plane in space to read GPS coordinates and change 10 meter shift to 10 cm shift
