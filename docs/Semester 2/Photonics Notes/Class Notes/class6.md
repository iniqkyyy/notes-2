# Photonics Lesson 6
- Radian is the angle that produces an arc of equal length to the radius.
- Angular measurement where the arclength swept by an angle is equal to the radius of the circle.
- Divergence angle of a laser beam.
- Competitive laser might have a divergence angle of 3 microradians
- Have angle and side length, solve using tangent $$tan\theta=\frac{opp}{adj}$$
- radian mode on calculator?
- Arclength = Radius * Theta
- convert radians to degrees?
- Snell's Law (first name Wildebrored)
  - Law of Refraction
  - $$n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}$$ where $$n$$ is an index of refraction based on the material (covered later semesters)
  - $$n$$ is related to the speed of light through the medium.
- Kinetic energy is $$\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
- To change the KE of an object you have to "do work" on it.
- Force an object through a distance and you're giving it Kinetic Energy
- Work Energy Theorem
- $$\Delta\text{KE}=W=Fd$$
- plot work vs velocity, exponential outcome, can you extrapolate 1/2mass without linearizing the data? is it the derivative?
