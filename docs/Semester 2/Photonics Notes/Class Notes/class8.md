# Photonics Lesson 8
- October 10th, Thursday, professional forum in bozeman
  - norm hall
  - discuss what's going on at montana state in various optics, photonics, and quantum research
  - morning is technical talks by various grad students, physicists, etc.
  - afternoon is a forum with local industry (maybe 2-4pm)
  - last year was CACI, hyperspectral imagers
  - end is a social put on by Montana Photonics and Quantum Alliance (MPAC)
    - founded by several prominent people in the area, funded by consortiuum of companies in the area
    - MPAC is raising awareness of the photonics and optics and quantum industry
  - OPTEC is the name of the forum
  - mark will register you and msu will pay for the student fee
- mark's goal:
  - begin getting involved in the technical community of our region
  - get professionally involved
- almost all students are able to do some level of pre-professional, pre-graduation work
- Company Names and people, explore them
  - Advr (research and development, fabrication of optical elements, making things) might have someone come and talk from here
  - Resonon (hyperspectral imagery, more electronics)
  - Quantum Composers (electronic equipment, laser systems, low weight low formfactor systems, more electronics)
  - Bridger Photonics (don't sell systems, sell data, methane gas mapping)
  - Teledyne/Flir (laser crystal fabrication, one of most advanced plants in country, make designators for military, both electronics and fabrication)
  - Aurora (autonomous driving systems, LIDAR techs, more electronics debugging)
  - Lumibird (largest laser manufacturer in town, more building laser systems for others)
- Student led group Optical and Photonics Society
  - lead by couple grad students in EE
  - recently had a speaker for salary negotiating
- Performance Enhancement Advanced Transistor MOS (PeatMOS)
- More involved with vectors in this class than physics
- Vectors
  - Mathematical construct that denotes something about a "quantity" that is "directed" in some way
  - Vectors include an angle relative to a coordinate system
  - Speed is a scalar, only describes a quantity
  - examples of vectors (velocity, momentum, electric field, magnetic field, gravitational field, force)
  - momentum is $$\vec{P}=mv$$
  - all vectors include an arrow above them, such as $$\vec{P}$$
  - you can connect any number of vectors, from nose to tail, and the connecting line will be the resultant always.
- Net
  - Physics and engineering uses the term "net" often
