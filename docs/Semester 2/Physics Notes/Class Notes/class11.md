# Physics Lesson 11
- No class next Monday
- Cash back opportunity
- Do similar problems to exam, get points back.
- Posted this week or next week.
## Momentum and Impulse
- #Momentum is a property of moving things. $$P=mv$$ where $$P$$ = Momentum, $$m$$ = mass, and $$v$$ = velocity.
  - Momentum is a vector
  - Momentum is in kilogram-meters per second
- #Impulse is a term to describe the change in an object's momentum. $$I=Ft$$ where $$I=$$Impulse, $$F =$$ Force, and $$t=$$ time.
- $$Ft=\Delta (mv)$$
- follow through makes t longer therefore more I.
- Impulsive Force is a force that acts for a very short period of time.
