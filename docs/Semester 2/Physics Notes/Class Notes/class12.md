# Physics Lesson 12
- Chapter 7 start
- this is the most important part of our lives, in Mark's opinion
- Work and Energy
  - Energy is the "mover" of substances.
  - Energy is observed when it is being *transferred* or *transformed*.
  - Energy is conserved, there's a finite amount and it never changes.
  - Work is $$W=Fd$$ where $$F = $$ Force in Newtons, $$d = $$ distance in meters.
  - Work is in units of Joules $$J$$ which are Newton-meters, or $$4.18J=1$$calories.
  - Energy is the *ability* to do work.
  - Energy is the stuff needed to do work.
  - "Net" work is the total work done on an object by all forces that act on it.
  - "Positive net" work is when an object is sped up from the work. Force and movement in the same direction.
  - "Negative net" work is when an object is slowed down from the work. Force and movement are not in the same direction.
- Power
  - Power is how *fast* work is done, or how fast energy is given away.
  - Power is $$P=\frac{W}{t}$$ where $$t$$ is time in seconds.
  - Power is in Joules per second or Watts $$W$$.
- kgm^2/s^3 = Watts
- mass * distance squared / seconds cubed
- in engineering we have a term for 100w lightbulb using 10w to make light and 90w to heat the room, stupid
- 1 square meter of sun = 1MW
