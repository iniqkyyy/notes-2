- Mechanical Energy
  - Potential Energy
    - can *become* kinetic energy but hasn't yet
    - energy that is "stored" in a position of an object, where that object is *able* to do work
    - streched bow, rubber band on a screenshot
    - something up on a hill, a charged particle on a voltage
    - because of their position they are being pulled on or pushed on
  - Kinetic Energy
    - kinetic = motion
    - $$KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
    - 
- gravitational potential energy
  - because of the elevated position of an object, it has joules of potential energy, because it could be pulled by gravity
  - formula for grav pot energy is $$PE_G=mgh=F_Wh$$
  - no work is done to move horizontally because nothing is resisting it
- Work-Energy Theorem
  - work is the change in kinetic energy $$W=\Delta KE$$
- **light has energy but no mass** and light is an exception to physics
- in high density electric vehicles, more pedestrian injuries
  - EVs have lithium ion batteries
  - lithium ion batteries are really heavy, so an equally sized car would have a longer time to stop
- EVs had to have sound created to make them safer so people could hear them
- parking structure full of EVs can't handle the weight, wasn't built with EVs in mind
- embrace the idea that there's always tradeoffs for everything
- resivoirs and dams generate electricity by spinning turbines using the potential energy, basically a battery for unconverted electrical energy
