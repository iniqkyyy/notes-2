# Physics Lesson 14
- 2 weeks from now exam
- finish Work & Energy today
- then wave/oscillatory motion
- that's the final topic for the exam
- then finally will be electrical stuff
- net Work done on object is the change in kinetic energy $$\frac{1}{2}m(v_f)^2 - \frac{1}{2}m(v_i)^2$$
- energy transforms without net loss or net gain
- momentum is a vector, kinetic energy is a scalar and cannot be cancelled
- potential energy $$PE=mgh$$
- kinetic energy $$\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
- momentum $$M=mv$$
- (simple) machines
  - things that will create force multipliers
  - change the direction of forces
  - cannot create or destroy energy, cannot multiply work or energy, only forces
  - $$W_i=W_o$$ so $$F_i*d_i=F_o*d_o$$.
  - fulcrum of a lever can be configured so large displacement * small force = small displacement * big force
- car break cylinder small plunger small force big plunger big force
- hat pad on rotor need change 30-90k miles, move very small amount but force massive
- why harder push multiple times? what pumping brake do?
- important : efficiency = useful energy output / total energy output
- space between sun and earth is not heat until the light transfers its electromagnetic radiation energy
- solid = bound together atoms, liquid is loosely bound
- water energy is ultimately created by the sun since water evaporate and fall back down higher up so we can use its potential energy again, gained by the sun
- more energy from sun hits earth in 1 hour than all energy consumed by mankind in a year
- batteries store energy in electro-chemical form 
- mark opinion
  - nuclear energy is relatively clean, no greenhouse gasses, etc.
  - byproducts are very small compared to the amount of energy created
  - opposite attract, likes repel, but in a nucleus the positively charged particles are so close to each other that they begin to attract eachother
  - split an atom, the nuclear bond breaks and a ton of energy is released since the positively charged protons are pushing away from eachother
  - kinetic energy from this explosion is then pushed into water and it heats up so much it becomes high pressured super heated steam, spins a turbine
- geothermal heating is (in mark's opinion) *the* best way to heat your home
- dig a hole 50ft down and you get some water that's ~52F, put it into a heat pump (steals heat from water), then dump the water back into the ground
