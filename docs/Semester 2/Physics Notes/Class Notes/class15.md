# Physics Lesson 15
- world series
- turboprop
- antithesis
- oscillatory or vibrational motion
- a *vibration* is a periodic wiggle in time
- a *wave* is a periodic wiggle in both space AND time
#### - curious about math behind pendulum cycle being equal regardless of mass
- period of pendulum $$t_{\text{period}}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
- waves are pictorially represented by a sine curve
- lick her wounds
- sin wave oscillation pen swinging above paper = sinusoidal response
- period of oscillation = time for particle of medium to go through one cycle
- frequency = 1 / period
- wavelength = distance on x axis between equal points of sine wave
- velocity = wavelength / period (T) = wavelength * frequency
- audible noise ~ 100-20000Hz
- radio waves ~ few million Hz
- cell phones ~ 5GHz
- more Hz, more options to change each phone and not muddy the airspace
- water transfers sound faster than air
- we can tell direction by determining the difference in the time it took for the sound to reach one ear over the other
- longitudinal wave
  - the medium moves "left and right" and the wave moves "left and right"
- transverse wave
  - medium moves "up and down" and the wave moves "left and right"
