# Physics Lesson 16
- $$V=f\lambda$$
  - V is constant in a given medium, so a change in f is proprtionate to an inverse change in $$\lambda$$.
- more waves
- two waves interacting with eachother = interference
  - also known as superposition, one superimposes onto the other
- all waves through time can be expressed as a summation of sine waves
  - forier analysis
- noise cancellation is just injecting the opposite sounds earbud hears and then playing what you're playing on top
- interference patterns crests and valleys overlapping from two interferences
- MRI magnetic resonance imagnig
  - nuclear magnetic resonance
  - spin magnetic, atoms in body oscillate and create electromagnetic field
- doppler effect
  - as police car comes towards you it's high pitched until it passes then it's low pitched
- bow waves
