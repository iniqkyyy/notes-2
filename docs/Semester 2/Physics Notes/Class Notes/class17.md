- sound is a form of energy
- most sound waves are produced by the vibrations of matter
- under ordinary conditrions, the frequencies of the vibrating source and sound waves are the same
- human hearting 20-20000Hz, below = infrasonic and above = ultrasonic
- sound waves are made of compressions and rarefactions of longitudinal waves
- sound can travel through any substance
- speed of sound 330m/s at sea level at 0 deg
- sound reflects, called an echo, multiple reflections called reverberation
- sound can also refract, or bend, due to change in the medium that it is traveled through
- ultrasound uses ultrasonic waves to reflect waves from the inside of our bodies, measuring the time it takes to reflect and map the difference
- intensity is how power is spread out over an area
- surface area of sphere scales with radius squared, therefore doubled radius = quadrupled surface area.
