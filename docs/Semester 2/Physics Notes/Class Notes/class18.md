# Physics Lesson 18
- exam has momentum, work energy, waves, oscillatory motion
- resonance imaging
- "in phase" means constructive interference
- "out of phase" means destructive interference
- forced vibration
  - heavy machine vibrating floor underneath it
- resonance 
  - a phenomenon in which the frequency of forced vibratioons on an object matches the object's natural frequency
- fundamental resonant condition is $$L=1/2\lambda$$
- beat frequency is the frequency of the murmur between two sounds (or any wave) that are close to one another
- beat frequency is $$\vert f_1-f_2\vert$$
- gallopin gertie
