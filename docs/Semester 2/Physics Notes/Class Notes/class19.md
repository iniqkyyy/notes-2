# Physics Lesson 19
- no class next monday
- free response 5 do conservation of momentum (P=MV) and not conservation of energy
- electrical stuff
- electricity is
  - the motion/flow of charges
  - lightning
  - sparks when strike match
  - what holds atoms together
- electrostatics
  - the forces between charges
  - the "aura" that surrounds them
  - how these charges behave
- Coulomb's Law
  - electrical force is directly related to the product of the charges, times a fudge factor K (9E9), and inversely related to the square of the distance between them
  - $$F_E=\frac{K\vert{q_1}\vert\vert{q_2}\vert}{d^2}$$
  - similarly, the force of gravity is similar except the constant G is much smaller than the electrical force constant K (6.67E-11)
  - $$F_G=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{d^2}$$
