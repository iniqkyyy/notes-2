# Physics Lesson 2
## Part 1
- Class is *conceptual* physics, not algebraic or deep math
- Homework solution always available online after hw due
- Exam dates are correct online, first end of sept, second early nov, final second week of dec
- linear motion, circular motion, oscillatory motion (back and forth, vibrating)
- set foundations on how objects move and the apply everywhere, electricity, sound, etc.
- everything technical uses metric units
## Chapter 3 Linear Motion
- #Relative-Motion
  - you might move 1m/s relative to the earth/ground, but you aren't moving relative to the person walking alongside you
  - this class is primarily about motion relative to the earth
- #Speed
  - speed is $$\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$$
  - class will use metric units, usually talking about instantaneous (not average)
  - speed is distance over time, an average
  - #Average denote with a bar above the unit i.e $$\bar{s}$$
  - #Instantaneous is a speed at an exact point in time, not averaged from surrounding time
  - constant speed is continuous speed in any direction without speeding up or slowing down
- #Velocity
  - velocity is a vector quantity, i.e it contains both the speed (magnitude) *and* direction
  - a richer, more descriptive piece of information
  - constant velocity would require both constant speed *and* direction
- #Acceleration
  - is a quantity of motion change expressed as a rate, acceleration is constant and increases velocity linearly
  - #Delta $$\delta$$ means "a change in"
  - Acceleration is defined as $$a = \frac{\delta V}{\delta t}$$ where $$V = \text{Velocity and} t = \text{time}$$
- #Free-Fall
