# Physics Lesson 20
- last week of physics 
- final next week on Monday (2pm - 3:50pm in same room)
- week 15 assignment is *suggested* problems but they may be on the final
- Dasher
- Dopant
- Overmorrow
### Basic Ideas of Applications of Electric Concepts
- charge flowing is like water flowing from high pressure to low pressure
- see slides, water pump moving from low pressure to high pressure is analogous to how batteries work
- metal electrons easily move, hence wires
- saline in blood makes it conductive due to ions salt
- batteries are ski lifts for charged particles
- amps are gallons/minute etc, coulombs per second
- work is done by pulling negative charges apart from positive ones (chemical electric)
  - checmical batteries do checmical disintegration of zinc or lead in acid
  - energy stored in checmical bonds is converted to electric potential energy
  - lithium and cobalt chemical bonds (goodenough) can be recharged
- light bulb filament is like attaching a straw to a pipe, friction of charged particles creates heat and light
- resistor *regulates* current flow
- resistance is inversely proprtional to cross-sectional area $A$, directly proportional to length $\ell$, and dependant on the material $\rho$
  - $$R=\rho\frac{\ell}{A}$$
- ohms law v=ir
