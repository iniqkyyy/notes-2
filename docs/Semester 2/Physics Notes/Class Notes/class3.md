# Physics Lesson 2
## Part 1
- friend in engineering meetings with elon musk
- speeding up downwards is the same as slowing down upwards
- calculate length of waterfall count time then use 1/2gt^2 algebra (g is 32ft/s or 10m/s)
- money drop game
- car desgin negative acceleration to account for slow reaction time
- Converting Units (Dimensional Analysis)
  - use square brackets to indicate unit conversion
  - HW will use m/s to km/h
  - $$[\frac{30m}{seconds}]*[\frac{1km}{1000m}]*[\frac{3600s}{1hr}]=\frac{30*3600m}{1000m}=\frac{108km}{1hr}$$
## Next Week
- Talk about object movement in 2D, simultaneous horizontal *and* vertical
- #Vectors
  - vectors are an arrow describing a physical property, velocity vector has direction (arrow) and speed (length of arrow)
  - vector could show a triangle of movement and use pythagoras to find length of hypotenuse
  - #Result is the length of the hypotenuse of horizontal and vertical components
