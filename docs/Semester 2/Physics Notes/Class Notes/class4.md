# Physics Lesson 4
## Part 1
- Review
- 2D Motion
  - Galileo's #Independence-of-Motion
    - How an object moves or is affected by forces in one direction has no effect
 on how the object moves in another direction.
 - Velocity has a vertical and horizontal component. Combining vertical and horizontal components creatures the #Result which is the direction the object is moving in.
 - Vertical and Horizontal velocities are unaffected by one another.
 - 45deg furthest horizontally, see after class for explanation
   - calculate range knowing starting velocity and angle
 - #Complimentary-Angles add up to 90deg and will travel the same distance horizontally, e.g 15deg & 75deg
