# Physics Lesson 7
# Part 1
- First test is in two weeks
- passcodes for the week show up on exam
  - epitaxy grow crystal material on another crystal material , sestet 6 lines of poem
- 3 things to take away, big Mu big M what is voltage
- scale measures normal force
- newtons are related to pounds, kilograms are related to measures
- static equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium
- only when forces are unbalanced you get a net force, and when you have a net force /=/ 0 then you receive acceleration
- force = mass * g, if mass doubles then force doubles, if force doubles then mass must doubles
- the force pulling them down increases or decreases according to the mass of the object
- the presence of air resistance, or a force added onto/against gravity, is what makes weight matter because the force downwards will be greater and the air resistance will not change based on weight, therefore acceleration is greater.
- free body diagrams, not in this class but neat
- nonfree fall is an object being acted upon by drag
- swimmer
- drag increases with speed and surface area
- if you are moving horizontally as well do you create even more drag and move slower? or is the drag then acting both horizontally and vertically separately
- drag is a resistive force against movement through a fluid
