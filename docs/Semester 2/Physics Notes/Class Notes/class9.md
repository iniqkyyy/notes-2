# Physics Lesson 9
- Monday is first exam.
  - Cover everything up to today. Wednesday is review.
  - review materials on D2L weekly folder
  - exam has a multiple choice and brief calculations, some free response questions
- secret words
  - Diode is an electrical device, only lets movement in one direction.
  - Capillary is a very small blood vessel.
- Rotational Motion and Centripetal Acceleration
  - truck moves forward but the rotational acceleration on the wheel is increasing
  - the form of a force that results in an object accelerating in a rotational direction is "Torque"
  - turn around an axis is circular rotation or Motion
  - tangential/linear speed and rotational/circular speed
  - Centripetal force
    - is a force that is fixed towards the center of a rotational path
    - centripetal force is mass x tangential speed^2 over radius
- Feeling a force pushed back upon us is necessary for human survival
- a centripetal force can be used to simulate gravity
