- #Relative-Motion you might move 1m/s relative to the earth/ground, but you aren't moving relative to the person walking alongside you
- #Average denote with a bar above the unit i.e $$\bar{s}$$
- #Instantaneous is a speed at an exact point in time, not averaged from surrounding time
- #Velocity is a vector quantity, i.e it contains both the speed (magnitude) *and* direction
- #Acceleration is a quantity of motion change expressed as a rate, acceleration is constant and increases/decreases velocity linearly both by speed *and/or* direction. Acceleration is defined as $$a = \frac{\delta V}{\delta t}$$ where $$V = \text{Velocity and} t = \text{time}$$
- #Delta $$\delta$$ means "a change in"
