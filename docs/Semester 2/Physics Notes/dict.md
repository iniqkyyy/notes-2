# Physics Dictionary
- #Relative-Motion you might move 1m/s relative to the earth/ground, but you aren't moving relative to the person walking alongside you
- #Average denote with a bar above the unit i.e $$\bar{s}$$
- #Instantaneous is a speed at an exact point in time, not averaged from surrounding time
- #Velocity is a vector quantity, i.e it contains both the speed (magnitude) *and* direction
- #Acceleration is a quantity of motion change expressed as a rate, acceleration is constant and increases/decreases velocity linearly both by speed *and/or* direction. Acceleration is defined as $$a = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t}$$ where $$V = \text{Velocity and} t = \text{time}$$
- #Delta $$\Delta$$ means "a change in"
- #Free-Fall an object accelerating *exclusively* (no air resistance) under the influence of gravity is in "Free fall" and are called "projectiles"
- #g free falling objects accelerate at ~$$10m/s^2$$ (more like 9.8) and is referred to as $$g$$.
- #Distance = $$\frac{1}{2}at^2$$ or $$\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
- #Vectors are an arrow describing a physical property, velocity vector has direction (arrow) and speed (length of arrow)
  - #Result is the length of the hypotenuse of horizontal and vertical components
