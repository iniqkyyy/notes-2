# ETEC 106 Catch Up
- Capacitors
  - Units of Farads
  - looks like "--||--" on a circuit diagram
  - Basically two metal plates split by a "dielectric" insulator, once enough power charges up on one side of the plates, they can split through like lightning to the other side.
  - Capacitance is equal to total charge over volts. $$C = \frac{Q}{V}$$
  - $$W=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$ where W is the energy, C is the capacitance, and V is volts
  - $$C=8.85\text{E-12}\frac{\epsilon_{r}A}{d}$$ where epsilon is the **relative** dielectric constant, A is the plate area, and d is the distance between the plates.
