# ETEC 106 Lesson 1
### Chapter 8
- Sine Wave Basics
  - AC signal = sinusoidal signal (typically)
  - see semester 2 physics later half for frequency, period, hertz, etc.
  - current flow direction swaps polarity in AC, still always pos to neg but sometimes the signs are flopped
  - peak value = amplitude
  - #Peak-To-Peak-Voltage is the sum of the abs pos and abs neg voltage peaks. $$V_{PP}=2V_P$$
  - #RMS-Voltage is the "root mean square" DC voltage that produces the same heat in a resistance as does the AC voltage. $$\text{RMS} = 0.707 * V_P$$
  - #V-Average is the average voltage but not used often. $$V_{\text{avg}} = 0.637 * V_P$$
  - #Instantaneous-Voltage is the voltage at any given angle on the sin wave. $$v=V_P\sin{\theta}$$
    - theta is the angle of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length peak voltage, starting at V0 and the peak of the triangle reaches the location of the solving voltage.
