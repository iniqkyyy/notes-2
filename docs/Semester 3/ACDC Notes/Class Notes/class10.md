# ETEC 106 Lesson 10
- RL series
  - voltage and current in phase in resistor
  - VR lags source, VL leads source
  - angle of
    - $$\arctan{\frac{X_L}{R}}$$
  - ohms law still applies, with Z replacing R
  - increase frequency, increase reactance, increase voltage drop across inductor
  - L-> R low pass filter, only low frequency
  - R -> L high pass filter, only high frequency
- RL Parallel
  - impedance
  - $$\frac{R*X_L}{\sqrt{R^2+X_L^2}}$$
  - current
    - total current still pythagorean
  - same reciprocal sub
    - conductance G = 1/R
    - susceptance B_L = 1/XL
    - admittance Y = 1/Z
- power in RL
  - apparent = Z
  - reactive = X
  - true = R
  - multiply impedance triangle by current to get voltage, again to get power
  - power factor is cos of angle
- cutoff frequency
  - $$f_c = \frac{R}{2\pi L}$$
