# ETEC 106 Lesson 11
- Series RLC circuits
  - current and resistor in phase
  - C 90deg offset from I 
  - L -90deg offset from I
  - total triangle is just absolute value of XL-XC
    - $$X_\text{TOT}=\|X_L-X_C\|$$
  - impedance
    - $$Z_\text{TOT}=\sqrt{R^2+X_\text{TOT}^2}$$
  - phase angle
    - $$\arctan({\frac{X_\text{TOT}}{R}})$$
  - voltage
    - $$V_S=\sqrt{V_R^2+(V_C-V_L)^2}$$
  - series resonance @ XL=XC
    - at resonance, they completely cancel eachother out and the equivalent circuit is just the resistor
    - $$f_r=\frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}}$$
    - below fr, I leads
    - at fr, I is in-phase
    - above fr, I lags
  - inductor has Q, remember this
    - $$Q=X_L/R$$
    - where R is the winding resistance
  - bandwidth of an RLC band-pass circuit
    - $$BW=\frac{f_r}{Q}$$
