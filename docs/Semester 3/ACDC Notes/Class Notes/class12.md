# ETEC 106 Lesson 12
## Parallel RLC circuits
- total reactance (or susceptance) is always absolute value of L-C
- L equivalent
  - $$L_{eq}=L(\frac{Q^2+1}{Q^2})$$
- R equivalent 
  - $$R_{eq}=R_W(Q^2+1)$$
- where Q is the quality factor XL/RW
- parallel resonant circuit commonly referred to as a tank circuit
  - holds energy like a storage tank
