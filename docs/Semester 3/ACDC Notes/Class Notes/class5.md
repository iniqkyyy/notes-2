# ETEC 106 Lesson 5
- Instantaneous Voltage
  - $$v_c=V_F + (V_i - V_F)e^{\frac{-t}{RC}}$$
- Capacitor reactance
  - $$X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}$$
  - where X is reactance, 2pi is constant, f is frequency, and C is capacitance. answer in Ohms
  - capacitive reactance works as a resistor
- current will always be 90 degrees ahead of voltage, current peaks at V=0
- frequency of power oscillation is twice that of voltage/current oscillation
