# ETEC 106 Lesson 7
- low pass filter
  - output from capacitor after resistor, allows low frequency
- voltage divider for RC circuits
  - $$V_{OUT}=V_{IN}(\frac{X_C}{\sqrt{R^2+X_C^2}})$$
- Cutoff frequency
  - $$f_c=\frac{1}{2\pi RC}$$
  - 3dB point on a 20log_10 scale
  - 70.7% of total value is being passed
  - phase angle is at -45deg
- high pass filter
  - output from resistor after capacitor, now it leads instead of lagging
  - gain is A_V
    - $$A_V=\frac{V_{OUT}}{V_{IN}}=\frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2+X_C^2}}$$
  - same cutoff frequency, but reversed
  - now it is positive 45deg phase angle
- Parallel RC circuits
  - instead of double reciprocal equations we just convert immediately
  - conductance in Siemens
    - $$G=\frac{1}{R}$$
  - capacitive susceptance in Siemens
    - $$B_C=\frac{1}{X_C}=2\pi fC$$
  - admittance in Siemens
    - $$Y=\sqrt{G^2+B_C^2}=\frac{1}{Z}$$
  - current
    - $$I_T=\sqrt{I_R^2+R_C^2}$$
    - $$\theta=\arctan(\frac{I_C}{I_R})$$
    - $$\theta=\arctan(\frac{R}{X_C})$$
    - this theta is the reciprocal of the theta in series
  - impedance
    - $$Z=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\frac{1}{R})^2+(\frac{1}{X})^2}}$$
    - instead with conductance, capacitive susceptance, and admittance
    - $$Y=\sqrt{G^2+B_C^2}$$
    - $$Z=\frac{X_CR}{\sqrt{X_C^2+R^2}}$$
  - ohms law
    - $$V=\frac{I}{Y}$$
    - $$I=VY$$
    - $$Y=\frac{I}{V}$$
- converting from parallel to series
- $$R_{EQ}=Z\cos{\theta}\text{ and }X_{EQ}=\sin{\theta}$$
- power in rc circuits
  - true power (resistor) is the P=IV WATTS
  - reactive power (across only capacitor) VOLT-AMPERES-REACTIVE = VAR unit
    - $$P_R=I_{T}^2X_C$$
  - apparent power (combined) VA (VOLT-AMPERES)
    - $$P_a=I_T^2Z$$
  - take resistance triangle (R XC Z) and multiply it by current for voltage, and again by current (or current squared) for power triangle
- Power factor
  - relationship between apparent and true power
  - $$PF=\cos{theta}$$
  - we want high power factor, meaning high true power and low apparent power
