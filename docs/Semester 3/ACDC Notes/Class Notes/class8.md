# ETEC 106 Lesson 8
- inductor
  - wires wrapped around a core
  - inductors are the opposite of capacitors
  - inductors hold current, conductors hold charge
  - inductors are L
  - core drawing
    - air core is just bumpy
    - iron core is bumpy with two parallel lines
    - ferrite core is two dashed lines
    - variable core (anything else) is an arrow diagonally through it
  - $$L=\frac{N^2uA}{l}$$
    - N is turns
    - u is permeability in henries/meter
    - A is cross sectional area
    - l is coil length
    - unit of Henries (H), usually milli
  - resistor represents the resistence of the wire called Winding Resistance (typically around 10 Ohms)
  - capacitance between each loop means to also accurately read an inductor you have to assume a capacitance too
- Faraday's law
  - the amount of voltage induced in a coil is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field with respect to the coil
- Lenz's Law
- Series/Parallel Inductors
  - Behave like resistors, just henries instead of ohms
