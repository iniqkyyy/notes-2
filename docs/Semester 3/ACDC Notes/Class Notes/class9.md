# ETEC 106 Lesson 9
- Inductors in DC Circuits
  - Remember for a "true" inductor you have a winding resistance
  - energy
    - $$W=\frac{1}{2}LI^2$$
    - L is inductance
  - Inductor is opposite of con
  - when switch closes, voltage across resistor slowly builds current
  - time constant
    - $$\tau=L/R$$
    - still 5 time constants to max/min current
  - instantaneous current
    - $$i=I_F+(I_i-I_F)e^{\frac{-R\tau}{L}}$$
  - voltage slowly decreases as inductor charges, when voltage turned off total voltage is negative slowly increases back to zero
- Inductors in AC circuits
  - reactance
    - $$X_L=2 \pi fL$$
    - XL different from XC!!
  - in series, add reactance like resistance
  - in parallel, combine reactance with inveres sum of inverse values
  - voltage leads current
  - true power 
    - $$I_{rms}^2R_W^2$$
  - quality factor is XL/RW in series, otherwise apparent power/true power
