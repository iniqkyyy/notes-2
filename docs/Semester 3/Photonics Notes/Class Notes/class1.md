# Photonics 101 Lesson 1
### Overview
- Barnard 110 lab, about 2/3rd of the time
- maybe MMF cleanroom tour late semester
- final presentation late semester on one of the lab topics
- lecture outlines
  - week 1-2 modules 1/2/3 EM Waves
  - week 3 mod 4 absorption & transmission
  - week 4 mod 5 polarization **heavy focus**
  - week 5 mod 6 light in nature
  - week 6-7 mod 7 materials
  - week 8-13 mod 8 **heavy focus** on lenses
  - week 14-15 mod 9
- Khan Academy helpful resources
- get LAB NOTEBOOK
- each student will be assigned ONE lab topic to completea full technical report
  - focus is heavy on theory rather than results
  - professional power point presentatio
- light moves about 1 foot per nanosecond
- review D2L stuff to remember everything
- electrons stimulated to higher energy band around atom then allowed to drop simultaneously and create trillions of photons making a laser
- #Wavefront the set of points where the wave has the same phase.
- #Ray is the direction of propagation of a wavefront.
- far from wave origin, the wavefront looks planar (tangent line of circle)
- can turn planar wavefronts into a circular wavefront, take multiple parallel beams and converge or diverge them
- when you have a planar wavefront, the rays are parallel, the light is collimated, and does not diverge
- laser light is generally very collimated due to the use of an optical cavity
