# Photonics 101 Lesson 11
- next wednesday second exam
- technical lecture discussion next class
  - oral report and document
  - presentation
- refracting telescopes
  - refracting and reflecting telescopes different
  - objective lens (first lens that captures light)
    - size of lens determines light gathering, LG ~ d^2 where LG is gathering capability, d is diameter
  - afocal system
    - no focal point
    - accepts collimated light, transmits collimated light
    - can expand or reduce the size of the beam
    - typically created by taking two positive lenses spaced by the sum of their focal length
  - kepler telescope
    - focus intra-lens (inbetween lenses) of two converging lenses that creates collimated light
  - gallilean telescope
    - no focus, one converging lens into a diverging lens, creating collimated light
- reflecting telescopes
  - gregorian
  - newtonian
  - cassegrain
  - light in, hits primary mirror at back of telescope, bounces to secondary mirror, into eyepiece lens halfway through telescope
- telescopes use massive lenses to collect an immense amount of light compared to our eyes, but shrinks the total light down to a size where our eyes can collect it all
- light gathering lens/mirror is OBJECTIVE
- the secondary lens/mirror is the EYEPIECE
- arizona/rochester biggets optical places
- magellan telescope in chile
  - reflecting telescope made in arizona
  - made of an array of spherical/parabolic mirrors
  - like 7 of them
  - around 7 meters in diameter
  - all of them collect light and reflect onto a tiny mirror in front of the 7, then to eyepiece 
  - tolerances of curvature to the order of 10s of nanometers on mirrors 7 meters across
  - use interferometric measurements if mirrors are within tolerance
  - size required due to truck overpass allowance
- keplerian telescope
  - rays through initial lens focus prior to the eyepiece lens
  - eyepiece lens creates nearly collimated light that produces a virtual image that is massively magnified
  - image is inverted
- galilean telescope
  - rays converge through positive light gathering lens, then diverged by a negative eyepiece lens, same effect
  - image is upright
- magnifying power
  - $$MP=\frac{1}{m}=\frac{F_{obj}}{F_{img}}$$
  - where F_obj is the objective lens focal length, and F_img is the image lens focal length
- telescopes as beam expanders
  - can use principals of a telescope to expand or reduce a beam of collimated light
  - in such systems, collimated rays enter and exit, therefore the system has no focal length
- microscopes
  - function similarly
  - objective lens with very short focal length
  - dont need a large lens because we can push extra light onto the object so it can easily be collected
  - a single lens is difficult to obtain larger than 5x magnification without distorting the image
  - using multiple leses we can create a compound microscope
  - after 400x magnification we get limited by diffraction, geometric optics fall apart
  - i.e when the object is as small as the wavelength of the light, we can no longer treat the light as rays
- electron microscopes
  - electron beam shoot at small object
  - receive backscattered electrons
  - based on angle and energy, discern physical nature of what they bounce off
  - create image from these electrons
  - two types, scanning or
  - tunnelling, electrons pass THROUGH a material and collected after object
  - uses quantum tunnelling
- microscope simulator in slides
