# Photonics 101 Lesson 12
- mirrors still use ray tracing and mathematical formulas to determine image placement and orientation
- Planar mirrors
  - image is virtual always
  - upright
  - no magnification
  - image is flipped along Z axis
- Spherical Mirrors
  - concave mirrors can create real images
  - still has focal point, half of radius
  - center of curvature, equal to radius
  - the center of curvature is the point that all normals lead to
    - due to the laws of reflection, at any point of incidence on a concave mirror, the reflection of a light ray will be equal angle to the normal that the incidence was, making collimated light reflect to the focal point, or half of the radius of curvature
    - likewise in convex mirrors, collimated light will seem to come from the focal length, half the raadius of curvature, "behind" the mirror
- Mirror Ray Tracing
  - Ray parallel to PA = reflects towards focal point
  - Ray that passes through focal point = reflects parallel to PA
  - Ray that passes through center of curvature = reflects directly back
  - Ray that reflects on the vertex (center of mirror) = reflects with equal angle mirrored across the PA
  - same applies to convex mirrors, just focal point and center of curvature are "behind" the mirror
- Concave mirror
  - real image if object outside focal length
  - virtual image if object inside focal length
  - object further = image closer to focal length and smaller 
  - object closer = image further from focal length and bigger
- Convex mirror
  - always virtual
- Quantitative/Mirror Equation
  - same as thin lens equation
  - $$\frac{1}{d_i}+\frac{1}{d_o}=\frac{1}{f}$$
  - f and C are positive for concave mirrors, negative for convex mirrors
  - di and do are negative when they are opposite of the mirror from the light
  - same magnification equation
  - $$m=\frac{h_i}{h_o}=\frac{-d_i}{d_o}$$
