# Photonics 101 Lesson 13
- Reflecting Telescopes
  - also has a primary/objective mirror and eyepiece/secondary mirror
  - mirrors are cheaper than lenses and work in wider spectrums of wavelengths
  - mirrors also only have to have one side polished, instead of the entire material
  - lenses also cause chromatic abberation, i.e different colors focus to different points, reflection does not care about wavelength
- Gregorian
  - object light enters, reflects off mirror to second mirror, then out the "bottom" of the mirror
- Newtonian
  - simple mirror that reflects out the side to avoid costly mirrors
- Cassegrain
  - same as gregorian with different shape secondary mirror
