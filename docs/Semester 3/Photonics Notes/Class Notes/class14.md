# Photonics 101 Lesson 14
- presentation
  - talk about a topic
  - talk about APPLICATIONS of the topic
  - talk about why its relevant
  - talk about current research
  - talk about experiment(s) relating to this topic
  - my topic is Polarization Techniques including Waveplates and Brewster plates
- Physical Optics
- wave optics, no longer rays, just waves mechanics
- works well when light interacts with features that are comparable to its wavelength, geometric optics (rays) no longer work at this point
- wave equation 
  - $$y(r, t)=y_0\sin(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(r-vt))$$
  - y is amplitude of wave
  - y0 is max amplitude
  - r is position in space relative to origin
  - v is wave velocity
  - (2pi/lambda)(r-vt) is the phase angle
- Huygens' Principle and Wavelets
  - at any point on a wavefront, no matter how planar/irregular they are
  - you can separate any points on the wavefront and they will behave as individual sources
- thomas young double slit 1801
  - took light source, allowed it to pass through an opening then through another two openings side by side
  - this should allow two COHERENT waves to be produced through both slits
  - this showed three interference fringes, i.e an interference pattern
- this interference response resulting from wavefronts incident on obstacles/apertures is known as diffraction
- PATH LENGTH difference determmines the phase offset at the "screen"
- PLD
  - $$\delta l = S_2P - S_1P = S_2Q = d * \sin{\theta}$$
  - d is the slit spacing
  - if PLD is a wavelength multiple, constructive
  - if PLD is a half-wavelength multiple, destructive
- fringe spacing always equal
- distant screen, paths from each slit are approximately parallel
- small angle approximation
  - $$y=m\lambda D/d$$
  - $$y_bright=\frac{\lambda D}{d}m$$
  - this is from the central point to the m'th fringe
  - $$\theta=\tan^{-1}{\frac{y_1}{D}}$$
- $$d\sin{\theta}=m\lambda=my(\frac{d}{D})$$
- can use this to determine spacing of atoms in a material, and to determine the purity of a lattice
- diffraction only occurs when the feature being interacted with is similar to the wavelength of the light
