# Photonics 101 Lesson 15
- different wavelengths are diffracted differently
- technical report and presentation on wednesday april 30th
- draft on 23rd
- far field diffraction
  - need collimated light incident (distance Z) onto a diffraction aperture AND a large distance from the aperture to the screen (Z')
  - generally the Z' distance needs to be above 100pir^2/lambda
  - convex lens can reduce this distance
- near field / fresnel diffraction
  - you will still see diffraction patterns with short distances
  - you will start to see fine pattern in the diffraction
- fourier optics
  - fourier transforms
  - math technique that allows you to represent a waveform in time that is irregular in a summation of sine waves
  - can do this in optcal context
- diffraction will occur in any slit shape, but will change shape based on the feature taht the light passes through
- a grating will create much more narrow brights/darks, reinforcing the diffraction of the light
- transmission gratings (diffraction) will disperse light into its individual wavelengths
- reflection grating
