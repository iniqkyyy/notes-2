# Photonics 101 Lesson 17
- oops paper due next wednesday
- on a chip
  - tungsten pillar coming up to allow wire (contact)
  - doped silicon (conductive) portions act as wires in the surface
  - metal-like material above undoped silicon
  - apply voltage to metal-like material and you have created a capacitor, allowing current flow through chip
  - this is a MOSFET bit
  - if wire going to overlap just move up another layer (z-axis)
- deposit films > pattern features in the films > etch them away > fill them up with new material
- photoresist chemical makeup changes when exposed to light, making it much more resistant to etching agents
