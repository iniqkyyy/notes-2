# Photonics 101 Lesson 3
- Critical Angle
  - $$\theta_C = \arcsin{\frac{n_2}{n_1}}$$
- Triangular prism, angle of incidence is non-normal, white light components separate into rainbow
- different wavelengths have different index of refraction
- as IoR getes smaller, wavelengths are longer, speed is higher
- lenses are shaped to exploit refraction and converge all light rays into a single point (forming an "image" plane)
## Absorption, Transmission, and Reflection
- Light, when interacting with a material, will either :
- Refract (Transmit)
- Reflect
- Absorb
  - Characterizing materials based on what they asbsorb, called their absorption/spectral fingerprint
  - distressed sugar beets absorb less light around 500-700nm and reflect more
  - in the fall leaves produce more carotenoids which reflect yellows and oranges
  - absorption coefficient is related to the thickness of material, properties of the material, and the wavelength of the incident light
  - $$I=I_0e^{-\alpha x}$$
    - $$I_0 = \text{the initial irradiance}$$
    - $$I = \text{the remaining irradiance}$$
    - $$\alpha = \text{the absorption coefficient per unit}$$
    - $$x = \text{thickness of material, same unit as }\alpha$$
- energy of light in = energy of light out (reflect + refract + absorb)
  - $$100\% = r(\lambda)+t(\lambda)+\alpha(\lambda)+s(\lambda)$$
  - reflect, transmit (refract), absorb, and specular reflect (in order above)
- Emission Line Spectrum
  - more next class
  - all materials have specific wavelengths that are emitted, can graph with spikes in each wavelength it is emitting
