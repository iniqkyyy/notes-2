# Photonics 101 Lesson 4
- Beer's Law
  - Concentration still $$I=I_0e^{-\alpha x}$$
  - alpha is the extinction coefficient
  - x is the concentration in decimal form
- Blackbody Radiation
  - Radiation = EM Emission
  - The spectrum of light emitted from an object that absorbs all incident light, or as in a heated object.
  - Objects will radiate across wavelength based on the internal heat energy it possesses
  - 5000 Kelvin lightbulb means it is emitting the highest intensity around 5000K, not that it is 5000K hot.
  - observations in the high frequency range gave rise tto our understanding of quantum oscillators and quantized energy
- original atomic models
  - plum pudding model
  - rutherford model
  - bohr model
  - schroedinger model
- electron cloud
  - we assign probabilities of the electron being at a certain position in the cloud around an atom
- atom structure
  - nucleus
  - multiple *discreet* orbital energy levels
  - quantum mechancis state there are forbidden reigons where electrons reside, and only allowed energy levels where electrons can reside
  - when atom is "excited" the electron will be sent to a higher energy level
  - if electron has exactly enough energy to move an electron from one shell to another, THEN it is absorbed
  - when the electron moves back to the "least effort" shell then a photon is again created based on the difference between the two energy levels
  - energy levels define emission and absorption spectra
  - incident photons with higher energy than any electron shell energy will rip the electron off the atom, ionizing it
  - incident photons with energies not equal to energy level differences simply transmit
- Coulombic Force between proton and electron = Gravitational Force
