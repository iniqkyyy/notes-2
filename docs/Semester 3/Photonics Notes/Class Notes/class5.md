# Photonics 101 Lesson 5
- Polarizing light is removing a component of the polarization (horizontal or vertical)
- Polarizers inherently have loss due to absorption
- half-waveplates rotate polarization
- quarter-waveplates change polarization to circle or vice versa
- waveplates do not eliminate horizontal or vertical waves, therefore no energy loss, they just slow one down relative to the other
- Brewster's Angle
  - having light hit an interface at Brewster's Angle will split it into a horizontal and vertical linear wave
  - the wave that is (the p component) parallel with the plane of incidence will refract
  - the wave that is (the s component) perpendicular with the plane of incidence will reflect
  - $$n_1\sin{\theta_1} = n_2\sin{\theta_2}$$
  - $$180 = \theta_1 + 90 + \theta_2$$
  - $$\theta_2 = 180 - \theta_1 - 90 = 90 - \theta_1$$
  - $$n_2\sin{90 - \theta_2} = n_2\cos{\theta_2}$$
  - $$\frac{sin{\theta_1}}{cos{\theta_1}} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
  - $$n_2 = n_1\tan{\theta_B}$$
- three ways to detemine n of material
  - snells law follow angles
  - TIR angle finding
  - brewster's angle
- physically finding brewster's angle, you want "p" polarized light to find where it totally refracts
- can use a polarizing beam splitter to get the poloarization of light we want to test for brewster's angle
- beam splitter splits polarization, reflection is parallel, transmitted is perpendicular, when looking top down plane
