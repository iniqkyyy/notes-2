# Photonics 101 Lesson 6
- Filters
  - Eliminate some component of light, polarizers act as a filter in one way
  - Material Response to Radiation (light)
    - Optical Responses
      - Transmission
      - Absorption
      - Reflection
    - Non-Optical Responses
      - Thermal
      - Chemical
      - Mechanical
- Window lets light through at specific ranges of wavelengths
- Reflectivity depends on 
  - wavelengths
  - angle of incidence (AOI)
  - polarization
  - material
  - chemical composition and structure of material
  - material and surface state
- Fresnel Equation
  - t = transmitted, r = reflected, s = perpendicular, p = parallel
  - $$t_s=\frac{2n_1\cos{\theta_i}}{n_1\cos{\theta_i}+n_2\cos{\theta_t}}$$
  - $$r_s=\frac{n_1\cos{\theta_i}-n_2\cos{\theta_t}}{n_1\cos{\theta_i}-n_2\cos{\theta_t}}$$
  - $$t_p=\frac{2n_1\cos{\theta_i}}{n_2\cos{\theta_i}+n_1\cos{\theta_t}}$$
  - $$r_p=\frac{n_2\cos{\theta_i}-n_1\cos{\theta_t}}{n_2\cos{\theta_i}+n_1\cos{\theta_t}}$$
- Material Scientists look at materials and look on an atomic level why they interact with light
- scratch and dig
  - the quantification of imperfections on a material
  - scratch is the dimensions of a defect 
  - dig is the diameter of a defect
- mechanical or thermal stress can cause damage to an optical component
- mfg process can leave unwanted particles, bubbles, minute cracks
  - very bad with high power lasers, can reflect in unexpected direction
- diverge laser beam onto a piece of paper "magnifying" whatever it traveled through optically
- Laser Damage Threshold (LDT)
  - limit at which an optic will be destroyed
  - fluence = total energy/area
  - intensity = power/area
- light dump = dissipate energy of light to avoid damage to detector
- Optical Filters
  - material or element that selectively sends some light through, and not others, based on wavelength
  - the properties of this are the "spectral radiometric" properties
    - Peak Transmission (highest rate of transmission)
    - Optical Density
    - Full width half max (FWHM), wavelength band where transmission is > 50%
    - Pass band, band at which light is transmitted > 5%
    - slope rate of transmission (how little wavelength is "wasted" being transmitted that we don't want)
  - Absorption Filters (Gel Filter)
  - Reflection Filter (Dichroic Filter)
  - Neutral Density Filter
    - ideal: absorbs same amount of light across all wavelengths
    - used to attenuate light
    - dependent on the intensity
  - step filter, allows wavelength to transmite above or below a threshhold
  - band filter, allows a band of wavelengths to pass through and none else
  - polarizing filter
  - Transmittance
    - $$t_1t_2e^{-\alpha_{\lambda} x}$$
    - t1 t2 is the filter correction factor
    - x is filter thickness
- optical coating
  - ARC = anti-reflective coating
  - put one material onto another and turn into an optic that either transmits or reflects extremely well
- Reflection
  - $$R = [\frac{n_1-n_2}{n_1+n_2}]^2$$
- Surface Reflection
  - infinite reflections inside material losing energy every time, growing slower
  - $$R_{ror}=1-[\frac{2n_r}{n_r^2+1}]$$
  - where $$n_r = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
    - where n2 is the refractive index of the window
    - n1 is the refractive index of the medium surrounding the window
- metal coatings are very broadband and highly reflective, cheap, not AOI dependant, and not polarization dependant
  - however, they fail quickly, cannot do multiple layers to enhance reflectivity, and absorb slightly so heating is a problem in high power applications
