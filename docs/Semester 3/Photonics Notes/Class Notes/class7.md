# Photonics 101 Lesson 7
- Interference based filters (dichroic)
  - thin films of materials on other materials
  - by using thin film, you get two reflections, one at the first interface and one between the film and the optic
  - specifically if the thin film is a quarter wave thick, the two reflected waves perfectly destructively interfere
- light hitting a medium with a higher n "sees" a fixed barrier (180degree phase shift)
- light hitting a medium with a lower n "sees" a free barrier
- reflections will also be out of phase if n*t is an odd multiple of a quarter wave length
- reflections will be in phase if n*t is an odd multiple of a half wave length
- $$K(\lambda)=2nt$$
- where t is film thickness, n is index of film
- K is:
  - for constructive interference w/ 1 phase shift = (m + 1/2), 2 phase shift = m
  - for destructive interference w/ 1 phase shift = m, 2 phase shift = (m + 1/2)
  - where m is an integer
  - 1 or 2 phase shift depends on how many total reflections will have phase shift (three mediums in a row with escalating IoR values would be two phase shift reflections)
- multi layer film
  - thickness and spacing of alternating high/low IoR allows even better reflection constructive/destructive interference
- to create = deposition chamber
