# Photonics 101 Lesson 8
- geometric optics (ray optics)
  - most integral part of this semester, longest time spent on this
  - useful in describing geometrical aspects of imaging and magnification
  - not useful for describing diffraction or interference effects
- physical optics (wave optics)
- Gaussian or paraxial (parallel and axis) optics
- Relationship between collimated light and focal points of spherical lenses/mirrors
- Ray-tracing techniques to locate the image plane & characteristics
- Differences between thin and thick lenses
- Basic properties of lenses
- Refraction Mirrors
  - assumptions
    - Rays propagate in straight-line paths as they travel in a single medium
    - Rays bend or split into two, at the interface between two dissimilar media
    - Rays may follow curved paths in a medium where the refractive index changes
    - Rays may be absorbed or reflected
- Lenses
  - a transparent refractive medium, with typically spherically shaped surfaces on the front and back
  - convex (positive or converging) = focal point
  - concave (negative or diverging) = spread
  - Optic Axis or Principal Axis (PA)
    - an axis normal to the lens surface that passes through the lens center -(-)-
  - Focal Point
    - the point where rays incident on a lens and *parallel to the PA* converge
  - Focal Length
    - distance between the lens **center** to the focal point
  - Focal Place
    - parallel rays will be focused to a point, somewhere on the plane of the focal point but not on the PA
  - Lens radius of curvature
  - the radius of the sphere the lens was taken from
    - for spherical lenses
      - $$r=2f$$
      - radius = twice the focal length
  - diagram like number line
    - lens at 0
    - number line is PA
    - mark focal length positive and negative
    - mark 2x focal length (lens radius) positive and negative
  - images are optically reproduced pictures of objects, are where rays converge
    - virtual image can be formed from concave lens, not real but our brain interprets it as real
  - Thin lens approximation
    - when drawing rays through a lens, just draw one bend instead of two and the approximation is practically fine
  - concave lenses create virtual images, all rays "appear" to have originated from the focal point/plane opposite to the observation
  - positive (or converging) lens will convert planar or spherical wavefronts to eachother.
  - "distant" means about 10 focal lengths
