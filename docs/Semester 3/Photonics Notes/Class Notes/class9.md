# Photonics 101 Lesson 9
- far field imaging, parallel, collimated light rays
- near field imaging does not form an image at focal plane
- image locations
  - Behind the lens means from the side the LIGHT is on
  - In front of the lens means from the side the light EXITS on
- orientation
  - upright
  - inverted
- magnification
  - reduced
  - enlarged
- image type
  - real means an image is formed by actual light rays on a screen
  - virtual means an image is "formed" from virtual, not real, rays
- qualitative ray diagramming
### refraction rules for convex spherical lenses, principal rays
  - any ray parallel to the principal axis will refract THROUGH the focal point
  - any ray that travels through the focal point **behind** the lens will pass through the lens and be traveling parallel to the principal axis
  - any ray that passes through the center of the lens will in effect continue in the same direction that it had upon entry
  - based on these three rules, wherever these three rays converge is where the image is formed
  - objects at 2f will not be magnified
  - objects closer than 1f will produce a virtual image that is heavily magnified
### refraction rules for concave spherical lenses, principal rays
  - any ray that is parallel to the PA will refract in a way where its origin seems to be the focal point
  - any ray that seems to be traveling towards the focal point **in front** of the lens will be refracted parallel to the PA
  - any ray that passes through the center of the lens will in effect continue in the same direction it had upon entry
  - based on these rules, despite no object being there, we will see the image of the object where rays converge
  - negative lenses can ONLY form virtual images
- quantitative thin lens equation
  - ray diagramming was not helpful for establishing numerical or quantitative values of images
  - thin lens equation
    - $$\frac{1}{d_o}+\frac{1}{d_i}=\frac{1}{f}$$
    - where
    - d_o, or p, is the distance the object is from the lens, POSITIVE if on SAME side as light
    - d_i, or q, is the distnace the image is from the lens, POSITIVE if image REAL, NEGATIVE if image VIRTUAL
    - f is the focal distance, POSITIVE for convex/converging lens, NEGATIVE for concave/diverging lens
  - Lens Magnification
    - $$m=\frac{h_i}{h_o}=-\frac{q}{p}=-\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$
    - where
    - h_i, h_o are the height of the image and object respectively
    - p (d_o) and q (d_i) are the object and image distance respectively
    - negative answer means the image is flipped
    - magnitude (or abs value) is the magnification, where 1 is equal size
