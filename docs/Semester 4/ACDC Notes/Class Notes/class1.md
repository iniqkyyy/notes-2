# Solid State Electronics Lesson 1
- Presentation less than 30min?
- Plagarize. Everything. Always.
- 19th last presentation (november) and hope to finish class on 19th

## Ch16 Diodes
- Semiconductors
- silicon etc has 4 valence electrons, wants 8
- past the valence band, the conduction band is where electrons become mobile
- electrons that jump to the conduction band are mobile
- electrons will fill holes, leaving new holes, repeating.
- 3 valence electron material added to make a hole, 5 to add an electron
- Diodes
- PN-junction, NP-junction
- p-region is mostly holes, n-region is mostly electrons
- forward bias
- when attaching voltage across a diode, you're adding electrons to the n-region "pushing" the electrons across the NP barrier
- **For a silicon diode, assume it is a 0.7V barrier.**
- model of diode, resistors on p and n region, with a backward voltage source in the middle
- when you reach bias voltage, the switch closes
- reverse bias
- electrons flowing into the P-region and cannot jump the gap, and now the negative is all on the p-region and the holes are all on the n-region
- reverse breakdown
- if you apply a high enough voltage for a long enough period of time the diode's part just start melting and falling apart
- diode models
  - ideal model has the current and voltage 90deg apart and no forward bias
  - practical model is once we hit the forward bias voltage the current is on
  - complete model includes the forward resistance where you lose some current for the voltage across the diode
  - VT is the voltage threshhold/barrier
  - VF is the forward voltage, giving ideal current
  - little negative current when you reverse it
  - BV voltage where reverse breakdown occurs
  - technically a diode has a capacitance effect across the PN-junction
- Half-wave Rectifier
  - when an AC source goes through a diode, the diode doesn't work when the voltage is negative so you "recitfy" half the wave and only get an oscillating positive voltage
  - $$V_{AVG} = \frac{V_{PEAK}}{\pi}$$
  - $$V_{newpeak} = V_{peak} - 0.7V$$
- Full-wave rectifier
  - diodes facing both directions, one on pos and one on neg, only one is ever on
  - $$V_{AVG}=2\frac{V_{PEAK}}{\pi}$$
- Bridge Rectifier
  - four diodes connected to both pos and neg
  - watch video for more
  - its output is the same voltage
- Diode clipping circuits
  - diode neg to pos with output in parallel
- need robot parts by mid sept
- download arduino
