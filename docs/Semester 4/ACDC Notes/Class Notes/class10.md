- Comparators
  - Zero level Detection
    - Inverting input that is grounded is the "reference" of the op-amp
    - As the signal crosses the grounded signal, you get a max or min, basically a square wave from an ac wave
  - Non-zero leve ldetection
    - Uses a voltage divider, when VIN is at the reference you get a max, and vice versa, so instead of a perfect square wave you have a single pulse followed by a constant negative voltage
  - Applications
    - Analog-to-digital for computers
    - Voltage-level detection
- Summing Amplifiers
  - Output voltage is proportional to the NEGATIVE sum of the inputs
  - rf=r1/2/3
- Averaging amplifier
  - rf=r1 divided by number of resistors
- Scaling adder
  - Each voltage input has a weight determined by resistor size
- Applications
  - Summing = audio to mix 
  - averaging = audio to reduce noise
  - averaging = medical systems to get exact AC
- Integrator
  - Uses capacitor as the feedback resistor
  - Does integration
- Differentiator
  - has a capacitor as the INPUT and resistor as the feedback
  - does differentiation
- Applications
  - differentiator -> detects edges
- Oscillators
  - Produces an AC output from a DC input
  - Wien-bridge
    - Lead-lag RC circuit, r+C + R||C
    - Kinda just makes a pulse of 1/3 the peak from vin
  - Triangle-wave
    - Uses a comparator with 2 trigger points and an integrator to produce triangle waves
  - Square-wave relaxation
    - Based on the charging/discharging of an oscillator
- Applications
  - signal generators
  - clock generation for timing signals
## Thomas 
- Low-pass active filter = an RC circuit into the non-inverting op-amp pin.
- High-pass active filter = a CR circuit into the non-inverting op-amp pin.
