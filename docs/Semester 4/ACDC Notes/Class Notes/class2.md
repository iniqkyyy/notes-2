# Solid State Electronics Lesson 2
- half-wave reectifier leading to capacitor
  - positive through diode and charge capacitor
  - during negative, the capacitor is discharging
  - repeat fast
- arrow coming off diode = LED
- special purpose diodes
- zener
  - angled line in front of triangle
  - made to work during breakdown
  - usually operate at 0.7v
- varactor
  - capacitor on the end of triangle
  - varying diode
  - change capacitance of diode material to change reverse voltage
- led
  - sometimes circle but always arrows coming out
  - instead of pushing electron flow through wire, it pushes them out as light
- photo
  - gamma above diode, or arrows coming in
  - like the light detector
  - collects light energy
