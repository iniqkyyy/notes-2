# Solid State Electronics Lesson 5
- TRANSISTORS!!!
  - Three terminals
  - Active region acts as amplifier
  - Saturation is fully on
  - Cut-off is fully off
  - Bipolar junction transistors (BJT)
    - Emitter (E), base(B, gate, middle), and collector(C)
  - NPN arrow goes towards the emitter, PNP arrow goes towards the gate (always towards the "N")
  - When a small current flows from the B to the E (voltage drop of around 0.7V) current can flow from C>E
  - Kinda like two diodes pointing towards the B
  - Usually labeled Q
  - BJT Reverse and forward biasing
    - for NPN
      - BC is reverse biased
      - BE is forward biased
    - for PNP
      - flipped
  - BJT Currents
    - $$I_E=I_C+I_B$$
    - $$I_C=\alpha_{DC}I_E$$
      - alpha is similar to gain (or efficiency) from the collector to the emitter, typically around 0.95-0.995
    - $$I_C=\beta_{DC}I_B$$
      - beta is amplification gain typically between 20-300
  - Voltage divider 
    - $$V_B=\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}V_{CC}$$
