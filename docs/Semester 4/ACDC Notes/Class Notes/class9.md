# Solid State Electronics Lesson 9
- Operational amplifier (Op-amp)
  - input voltage multiplier
  - two inputs, one inverting other noninverting
  - the two inputs are technically connected by a high resistance R_IN
  - the output has a resistance but usually less than 100
  - diff amp filters noise
    - equal emitter currents (IRC/2)
    - collector equals emitter current
    - differential mode = inputs out of phase, common mode = inputs in phase
    - in common mode, inputs being in phase means outputs are out of phase, therefore cancelling out
    - Common Mode Rejection Ratio
      - $$\text{CMRR}=\frac{A_{v(d)}}{A_{cm}}=20\log(\frac{A_{v(d)}}{A_{cm}})$$
      - Where A_v(d) is the gain of an ideal differential mode, and A_cm is the gain of the common mode.
  - Open loop gain
    - $$A_{OL}=\frac{V_{out}}{V^{+}-V^{-}}$$
  - frequency vs gain chart, keep gain above half power
  - want to stay below the cutoff frequency
- Slew rate = slope of voltage vs. time
