## Class
- #Hyperbolic-Functions
  - When gravity is the only thing affecting a system, hyperbolic functions appear everywhere.
  - $$\cosh{\frac{e^t+e^{-t}}{2}}$$
  - $$\sinh{\frac{e^t-e^{-t}}{2}}$$
  - Derivative of each other.
  - The graph of 
  - $$x^2-y^2=1$$
  - Is like the unit circle but makes an "x" shape and the hyperbolic functions are on that curve.
