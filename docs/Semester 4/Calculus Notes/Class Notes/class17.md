# Calculus 1 Lesson 17
- #Local-Min-Max
  - Local mins and maxes always correspond with locations where the derivative is either 0 or undefined.
- #Critical-Number
  - A function f has a critical number at x=c provided that c is in the domain of f and either f'(c)=0 or f'(c) dne.
  - $$(∃δ>0 s.t. ∀x,∣x−c∣<δ⟹f(x)≤f(c))⟹(c∈dom(f)∧(f′(c)=0∨¬∃f′(c)))$$
- #First-Derivative-Test
  - Let p be a critical number of a continuous function that is differentiable near p:
    - If f' changes from postiive to negative at p, then p is a local max.
    - If f' changes from negative to positive at p, then p is a local minimum.
    - If f' does not change signs at p, then p is neither a max nor min, local or not.
