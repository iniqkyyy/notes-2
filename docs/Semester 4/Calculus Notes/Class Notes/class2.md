# Calculus 1 Lesson 2
- #Limit the limit of a function is the value of the ouput as the input approaches, but does not reach, a given value. Given a function f, a fixed input x=a and a real number L, we say that f has a limit as x approaches a, and write the formula provided that we can make f(x) as close to L as we like by taking x sufficiently close (but not equal) to a.
  - $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$
- no imaginary numbers in this class, keep it real
- #One-Sided-Limit
  - Left/Right limit shows the approached value from the left or the right ONLY.
  - $$\lim_{x\to A^-} \ \text{or} \ \lim_{x\to A^+}$$
