# Calculus 1 Lesson 8
- #Point-Evaluation
  - There is a point on a graph at an x value. You can plug the number into the function an get a valid answer.
- #Continuity
  - No holes, gaps, or vertical asymptotes in the graph, i.e the curve is connected.
  - $$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=f(a)$$
  - If a function is continuous at x=a, then its limit must also exist at x=a.
- #Differentiability
  - A function f is differentiable at x=a whenever f'(a) is defined.
  - Note: there must be a tangent line at x=a. Looking at the graph it should be locally linear.
