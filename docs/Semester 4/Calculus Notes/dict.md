## Limits
- #Limit the limit of a function is the value of the ouput as the input approaches, but does not reach, a given value. Given a function f, a fixed input x=a and a real number L, we say that f has a limit as x approaches a, and write the formula provided that we can make f(x) as close to L as we like by taking x sufficiently close (but not equal) to a.
  - $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L$$
- no imaginary numbers in this class, keep it real
- #One-Sided-Limit
  - Left/Right limit shows the approached value from the left or the right ONLY.
  - $$\lim_{x\to A^-} \ \text{or} \ \lim_{x\to A^+}$$

## Derivatives
- #Derivate
  - Let f be a function and x = a where a is in its domain.
  - The derivate of f with respect to x evaluated as x = a, or written as
  - $$f'(a)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(h)}{h}$$
  - Provided the limit exists, the derivative is the slope of the tangent line at point (a, f(a)).
  - $$f'(a)=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$
- #Derivative-Function
  - Let f be a function and x any value in its domain. We define the derivative of f, a new function called f' by:
  - $$f'(x)=\lim{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
  - providing the limit exists.
- #Graphing-Derivative
  - Where f(x) is flat, f'(x)=0.
  - In each non-zero intervals, figure out the approximate slope of the steepest point and approximate a tangent line's slope. Plot that point and "curvily" connect it to your next-adjacent zero-points.
- #Direct-Substitution
    - Plug your actual limit into a function, either you get:
    - Valid answer, done
    - Non-zero over zero -> vertical asymptote
        - two up = inf
        - two down = -inf
        - one up one down = does not exist
    - rest -> indeterminate (need to rewrite)
- #Estimate-Derivatives
  - #Forward-Difference
    - $$\bar{V}_{[a, a+h]}=\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$
  - #Backwards-Difference
    - $$\bar{V}_{[a-h, a]}=\frac{f(a)-f(a-h)}{h}$$
  - #Central-Difference
    - $$\bar{V}_{[a-h, a+h]}=\frac{f(a+h)0-f(a-h)}{2h}$$
- #Increasing-Decreasing-Function
  - Given a function f(x) defined on (a,b):
    - f is *increasing* provided for all y, z in (a,b), if y < z then f(y) < f(z)
    - f is *decreasing* provided for all y, z in (a,b), if y < z then f(y) > f(z)
- #Concavity
  - Let f be a differentiable function on (a,b):
    - f is concave up on (a,b) if f' is increasing on (a,b)
    - f is concave down on (a,b) if f' is decreasing on (a,b)
    - f has no concavity on (a,b) if f' is constant on (a,b)
- #Second-Derivative
  - $$f''(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}$$
- #Point-Evaluation
  - There is a point on a graph at an x value. You can plug the number into the function an get a valid answer.
- #Continuity
  - No holes, gaps, or vertical asymptotes in the graph, i.e the curve is connected.
  - $$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=f(a)$$
  - If a function is continuous at x=a, then its limit must also exist at x=a.
- #Differentiability
  - A function f is differentiable at x=a whenever f'(a) is defined.
  - Note: there must be a tangent line at x=a. Looking at the graph it should be locally linear.
- #Local-Linearization
  - To find the slope-function for the tangent line at point x=a of f(a).
    - $$L(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$
    - Might remember it as
    - $$y=y_1+m(x-x_1)$$
- #Derivative-Rules
  - Constant
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}(c)=0$$
  - Polynomial
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}(x^n)=nx^{n-1}$$
  - Power
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}(a^x)=\ln{a} \cdot a^x$$
  - Constant Multiplier
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}(c\cdot f(x))=c\cdot f'(x)$$
  - Sum/Difference
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)\plusmn g(x))=f'(x)\plusmn g'(x)$$
  - Product
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)g(x))=f(x)g'(x)+f'(x)g(x)$$
  - Quotient
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)})=\frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}$$
  - CHAIN!
    - For when you have a composite function, derivative of the outside (copy of the inside) times the derivative of the inside.
    - Always start on the outside function.
    - $$\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x))=f'(g(x))g'(x)$$
- #Trig-Derivatives
  - $$\sin x=\cos x$$
  - $$\cos x=-\sin x$$
  - $$\tan x=\frac{\cos^2x+\sin^2x}{\cos^2x}=\frac{1}{\cos^2x}=\sec^2x$$
  - $$\cot x=-\csc^2x$$
  - $$\sec x=\frac{\sin x}{\cos^2 x}=\tan x \sec x$$
  - $$\csc x=-\cot x \csc x$$
- #Evaluation-Bar-Notation
  - $$\frac{dy}{dx}\biggr|_{x=a}=y'(a)$$
- #Composite-Function
  - A function inside a function.
    - $$f(g(x))$$
    - or
    - $$(f\circ g)(x)$$
