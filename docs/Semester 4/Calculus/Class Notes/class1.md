# Calculus 1 Lesson 1
- use desmos for function evaluation
- slope = ROC = m = rise/run = delta y/delta x
- interpretation make sure you include all information and units, self contained
- instantaneous velocity
  - $${IV}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{s(x+h)-s(x)}{h}$$
- find IV on graph by drawing a tangent line at point
