# Photonics 1 Lesson 11
- Dr Kenneth A Krauss
  - PhD from MSU
- R&D for gov and commercial contractors
- Solid state physics!
- wow this is impressive
- all subatomic particles are either Bosons or Fermions
- Bosons
  - have integer spin of 0, 1, 2, etc.
  - photons
- Fermions
  - have half-integer spin of 1/2, 3/2, etc.
  - electrons
- pauli exclusion principal -> fermions cannot occupy the same energy state
- Principal quantum number
  - the orbit number
- azimuthal quantum number
- magnetic quantum number
- spin quantum number

## Thermodynamics Basics
- Zeroth law of thermodynamics
  - If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
- First law
  - Any energy in a system cannot be destroyed, only change forms
- Second law
  - S, the total entropy of an isolated system, can never decrease over time
  - natural processes tend to move towards a state of greated disorder or entropy
- Third law
  - as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, its entropy approaches zero
- Boltzmann
  - $$S=k_B\ln{M}$$
  - S is entropy where M is the number of microstates accessible to a system, and k_B is a constant
  - macrostates are like temperature, volume, etc.
  - deduced that all microstates are equally probable

## Particles
- Like molecules, you can follow any classical particle with a velocity and position and.
- In quantum particles, however, you cannot determine the difference between two particles. They are indistinguishable.
- Heisenberg Uncertainty
  - $$\frac{\delta x}{\delta P}\geq\frac{\hbar}{2}$$
- permutations of 3 E-level 2P system
  - classical - 9
  - boson - 6
  - fermion - 3
- because all are equally probable:
- classical permutations:
  - you can have AB, BA, CA, AC, BC, CB
  - $$P(g, n)=\frac{g!}{(g-n)!}$$
- quantum permutations
  - you can only have AB, AC, BC
- degeneracy of 4, that means we have 4 states within the same energy
- for given energy level with degeneracy g and number of occupying particles n
  - $$m_j=\frac{g_j!}{n_j!(g_j-n_j)}$$
- total energy of a system
  - $$U=\sum_jn_j\epsilon_j$$
- system will always maximize entropy
- maximize these formulas by setting derivative to 0 (peak or valley)
- see deriving fermi dirac
- lagrange multiplier
- final result of required n for maximum entropy of fermions
  - $$\bar{n}_i=\frac{1}{e^{\epsilon_i-\epsilon_F}/k_BT+1}$$
- for classical you get something else
- the Boltzmann distribution shows the distribution of all particles in a closed system
- fermions is 1/(a+1), bosons is 1/(a-1), and classical is just a where a is the whole exponent portion
- fermi goes to 1 horizontally, bose goes to infinity
- as heat is applied to fermi electrons, 50% chance to be at the fermi energy level, at 0K, all particles will be at fermi energy level
- fermi energy level is the middle of the gap between the valence band to conduction band
- electrons are strange!
  - $$E=\frac{e}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2}$$
  - where r is the radius of the electron, but we have never determined the size of an electon, and as r tends toward 0 its energy will go up to infinity
- well actually electrons don't exist as particles, but instead an excitation of a field
- field theory
  - electrons are a vibration in the electron field, this is why all electrons are identical
- gamma ray can excite two electrons simultaneously
- in a vacuum there are virtual particles that fluctuate and the only rule that applies is that the total energy must be zero (virtual particle + hole)
- the cause of spontaneous emission is the virtual particle interacting with the electron causing it to drop
- Dirac said that in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), that describes the interaction between current and EM potential. This was successful in explaining the phenomenom of spontaneous emission.
