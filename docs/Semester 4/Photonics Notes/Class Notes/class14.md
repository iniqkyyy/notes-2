# Photonics 1 Lesson 14
- Photon Detector
  - Absorbs the energy of a photon as charge in a charge carrier (electrons)
- Thermal detectors
  - Absorb energy of a photon as heat and detects the change in heat using a changing electrical resistivity
- Photodetector steps
  - Absorb
    - electromagnetic energy, photons, are absorbed producing energic free electrons
  - Transport
    - 
  - Collect
- Diffusion Currents
  - Arises from the movement of charge carries from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration
  - When a pn junction diffuses, there's a negative voltage on the p-side and positive voltage on the n-side
  - this creates a drift current, where a diode with no external bias will tend towards a drift current flowing from n->p type
  - but the diffusion current, the holes flowing p->n, will cancel this out at equilibrium
  - 
- Solar Cells
  - Video for detail at the end of slides
  - np junction with light shining on it will create high energy electrons that jump the gap from n->p
  - when electron and hole recombine without being collected by the front and back electrical contacts, this is just heat energy and it is "lost"
- Mobility
  - Electron and hole mobility can be determined as a "speed" (mu), solar cells use a high mobility n-type and low mobility p-type
  - this is caused by a change in effective mass between an n-type and p-type, with n-type having lower effective mass
  - valence band is typically more complex as its composed of more energy levels
  - this means we have low efficiency transporting holes and they are more likely to scatter when interacting with phonons
- Indium Arsenide
  - Direct bandgap
  - small effective mass for the conduction band because it is a very sharp parabola
  - light holes (sharp parabola) have higher mobility 
  - heavy holes (flat parabola) have lower mobiltiy
  - this means you have two types of holes, some that move easily and some that move poorly
  - electrons instead will always have a low effective mass, meaning you have much more mobile electrons compared to holes
- Solar Cell Efficiency
  - Shockley-Queisser limit for the efficiency of a solar cell relates the efficiency to the bandgap
  - Maxes out around 1.5eV at 31%
  - To get large voltage difference you need a large bandgap
  - However this decreases the likelihood of photon absorption
  - Silicon has the bandgap around 1.5eV meaning it has similarly high efficiency
  - Basically, at low bandgap, electrons can freely relax to band edges rather than migrating to the metal contacts, but at high bandgaps, less photons are able to be absorbed
- Triple Junction solar cells
  - 39.5% terrestrial and 34.2% space efficiency
  - Not used because it's way too expensive and cost inefficient
  - Use a layer of high bandgap material to absorb the high energy photons, but losing most low energy photons
  - Use a SECOND layer of lower bandgap material to absorb to lower energy photons that passed through the previous layer
  - Use a THIRD to do the same
  - there's so many solar cell designs that have varying efficiency and prices, look at NREL Best Research-Cell Efficiencies graph
- Measuring Light Intensity
  - Metrics in Photodetectors
    - Responsivity
      - $$R=\frac{I_P}{P_o}$$
      - How much input current for output power.
      - Silicon can only detect so little energy photons before its less than the bandgap energy (forbidden)
      - Other materials like germanium and indium-gallium-arsenide can detect smaller energy photons like IR
    - Quantum Efficiency
      - $$r_i=\frac{I_p/e}{P_o/h\nu}$$
    - Noise-Equivalent Power (NEP)
      - Measure of the sensitivity of a photodeteector, basically just how discernable is your detector compared to its noise
      - Caused by dark current, even in the dark there's thermal excitation in the electrons in the sensor, causing a constant noisy current despite no light
      - Measureed in Watts/sqrt(Hz) because if you integrate for half a second that is the power you can discern
      - Typically in the 10^-12 to 10^-19 watts ffrom silicon to superconductors
    - Detectivity
      - 1/NEP
  - Some photodiodes are made similar to triple level solar cells and have multiple layers of different material that will absorb more photons (compound detector)
- Detectors can be photovoltaic or photoconductive
  - Creating voltage or current
  - Photovoltaic cell is a solar cell
    - This minimizes dark current
  - Photoconductive cell is a REVERSE biased diode
    - This creates a current flow when electrons are excited
    - Increases sensitivity, reduces junction capacity that increases high frequency response
    - Extends range of linear response (more wavelengths can be detected)
- Materials and Applications
  - Silicon -> solar cells and sensors
  - Germanium -> IR deteectors
  - Cadmium Sulfide -> Photocopiers, imaging devices
  - Cadmium Slenide -> Light sensors, applications
  - Indium Tin Oxide -> Touchscreens, tarnsparent electronics
  - Polyvinyl Carbazole -> Photocopying
- Photoconductors
  - As a photoconductor heats up, its resistivity changes
  - Just a resistor that changes with the amount of light shone on it
- Avalanche Photodetector
  - Creates many electrons from a single photon
  - Reverse biased until right before the breakdown (at shoulder), then add a little light and it will cause a massive avalanche amplification of current for a single photon
  - Some have gains of up to 1000
- PIN Diode
  - N-type over p-type with a large intrinsic region
  - Can apply a large voltage on the intrinsic portion, which acts like a raging river where the moment an electron hole pair enters the intrinsic material it getse swept away, increasing efficiency
- Phototransistor
  - Literally just a transistor turned on by way of photon collection reducing/increasing width of depletion region of the base/gate
  - Better amplification because you're collecting from two
- Nanowire Detector Single Photon Detection
  - Superconductor wire exposed to a photon causes a little heat, ruining its superconductivity
  - Single photon cameras made as an array of a ton of nanowires all put on a bus system to take images of single photons
- Photomultiplier tube
  - Works by photoemission
  - Vaccuum tube that absorbs a photon by way of emitting an electron that bounces between dynodes collecting multiple electrons until it hits an anode that reads out an electrical signal based on a single photon
