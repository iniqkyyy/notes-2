# Photonics 1 Lesson 4
- thursday start at 3pm
- **headwaters tech hub**
- big research program
- not exclusively for MSU but mostly (hope Gallatin)
- 52bil CHIPS act carve-out (multiple billions)
- establish tech hubs that nominally focused on design instead of research
- capitalize regions of country that are underdeveloped rather than places like silicon valley or austin texas
- montana was identified as a tech hub locality on remote-sensing technology enabled by photonic capabilities
- building and enhancing private sector jobs
- kickoff thursday/friday for people around the state looking to invest here
## Class
- #Natural-Frequency
  - A system will have a "want" to oscillate at a specific frequency regardless of amplitude, only dependant on the "length of the string".
- #Resonance
  - A system that is oscillating at a #Natural-Frequency or a multiple of it.
- pipe of given length requires an antinode at open side and a node at the closed side to be resonant
- open-ended pipe of given length requires an antinode at both the open sides
- two fixed barriers (guitar string) requires node at both ends
- basically fixed barrier = node, free barrier = antinode
- for double fixed or double free barriers
  - $$\lambda=\frac{2L}{m}$$
  - where L is the length of the material, m is an integer
- for opposite barriers
  - $$\lambda=\frac{2L}{m}$$
  - where L is the length of the material, m is an integer PLUS 0.5
- Resonant cavity
  - creating light in a container, confining the light by having it achieve a resonant condition in its container
  - excitation mechanism makes a medium the light is traveling through "gain" energy
  - one side is not a perfect mirror and allows a very small percentage of it out (the laser)
- a single emission of a photon leads to a stimulation of nearby electrons to emit a photon of coherent light
