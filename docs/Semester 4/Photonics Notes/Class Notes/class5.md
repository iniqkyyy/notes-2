# Photonics 1 Lesson 5
- atomic bands
- when bonds are made, electron energy levels could change
- in molecules, both electron energy, vibrational energy, and rotational energy
- atoms have energy LEVELS, molecules have energy BANDS
- $$\equiv$$ 
- means "is defined as"!
- valence shell
  - at 0K, the highest energy level that is filled
- conduction shell
  - the next higher energy level above the valence shell, i.e the first unfilled level when no rotation or vibrational energy is present
- band gap
  - the difference between the energy requirements for the conduction and valence shells
- energy transfer in an atom
- radiative (photon)
- collisional (momentum/kinetic energy)
- lattice vibrations called phonons (acoustic)
  - if resonant, elastic collisions
- direct band-gap and indirect band-gap
  - at different momentum energies, the valence energy level increases and the conduction energy level decreases
  - direct means valence max and conduction min are at same momentum
  - indirect means valence max momentum is different from conduction min momentum
- blackbody radiation
  - a true blackbody would have 100% absorptivity and 100% emissivity
  - we have things around 99% that would be called greybodies
  - the sun is treated typically as a blackbody
- incandescent optical sources
  - just blackbodies
  - when you heat something up in oxygen, they want to burn
  - we heat up tungsten in a thin filament so it can emit most of its energy on the outside instead of inside
  - put it in an inert gas like halogen so it doesn't burn
  - boom incandescent bulb
- make something into a plasma and look at what light comes out = know what was in the dirt
- put electron up in high energy, send a photon that WOULD be absorbed to that energy, and the electron drops and you get two photons out that are coherent
