# Photonics 1 Lesson 6
- Shine light on gain medium to excite electrons to a higher energy level.
- #Injected-Current
  - Creates a population inversion
- Laser diode activates at a lasing voltage
- Critical to account for wavelength fluctuations and lasing voltage based on temperature of the laser diode
- mirror on each side of gain medium, one highly reflective to lasing wavelength and one partially reflective
- #Population-Inversion
  - Metastable state, or long-lived state, slightly lower than pump energy
- Only get stimulated emission when everything else is already stimulated, otherwise it'll just get reabsorbed
