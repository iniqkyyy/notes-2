# Physics 1 Lesson 1
- Guest Speaker
- **Physics help center** 9-5 mon-thurs 9-4 fri second floor barnard room 230
- Peer mentoring program
  - barnard 242
  - optional program
  - meet twice a week mon/wed or tues/thur
  - small room meeting with problems like homework written by your professor to work together in
  - if you want materials you can ask for them
- exams are 40pts, need 20pts or better
- class average is 27pts WOW
## Assignments
### Reading assignment for wed 27th read ch 3 s 3 and ch 4 s 1-3
### lab #1 motion fill out pre-lab BEFORE lab
- 400 people in class
- post lab can be done in lab or not, scan all and turn in single PDF into canvas lab course
- recommend do all in notebook
- **PUT YOUR LAB SECTION NUMBER IN HOMEWORK BY NAME** MINE IS 010 TUESDAY 12-2pm
- if my TA is Aylin her email is under "Sima"
### HW due wed 27th
## Class
- vector addition
- averages are not a very good way to describe reality, you want instantaneous quantities
- if you know position as a function of time, the velocity is the slope of that
- zoom in on a curve so far it becomes a straight line now you know your slope at that instantaneous point
- tangent on a curve will be the slope at that point
- finding derivative
  - $$v(t)=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{dx}{dt}$$
  - $$f(t)=At^n \to \frac{d\ f(t)}{dt}=nAt^{n-1}$$
- average is any change in time, instantaneous is the limit as t approaches 0
- derivative of a parabola is a straight line, derivative of a straight line is a constant
- acceleration
  - $$\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}$$
  - in meters per second per second or meters per second squared
- most things are constant acceleration in the world, eg gravity (9.8m/s^2)
- if you have a 2 dimensional linear graph then just rotate it so it's a 1 dimensional graph where it is along the x axis
