## Clicker Questions
- Which has more kinetic energy?
  - 10kg moving at 5m/s or 5kg moving at 5m/s? first!
  - 4kg moving at 1m/s or 1kg moving at 4m/s? second! velocity changes the output more than mass.
- Centripetal force's work relates to what?
  - Nothing, centripetal force does no work, it's angle is 90deg from the direction of travel, and cos(90deg)=0.

## Energy
- #Energy
  - Is the capacity for something do do work. Measured in Joules.
  - Final energy is the initial plus the amount of work done on the object.
    - $$E_f=E_i+W$$
- #Work
  - Is a vector dot product, the amount of energy exerted on an object.
    - $$W=\vec{F}\Delta{\vec{x}}$$
- #Kinetic-Energy
  - The energy of a moving object. Increases/decreases based on net force on the object.
    - $$\text{KE}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
  
## Dot Product
- Two vectors dot product is the magnitudes times cosine of the angle between them.
  - $$\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=|a||b|\cos{\theta}$$
- See #Vector-Multiplication
