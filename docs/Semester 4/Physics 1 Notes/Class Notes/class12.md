# Physics 1 Lesson 12

## Clicker Questions
- Box moving up an incline or across a horizontal then lifted to same height, which took more energy?
  - Both are equal, the horizontal movement has no work done, the force applied to start movement is equal to the force applied to stop movement.

## Energy
- #Conservation-of-Energy
    - $$KE_f+PE_f=KE_i+PE_i+W_{ext}$$
    - This is equivalent to
    - $$\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2+mgh_f=\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2+mgh_0+\vec{F}\cdot{\Delta{\vec{r}}}$$
- When using mgh for PE means the work the earth does is NOT part of the external work

## Kinematics vs. Conservation of Energy?
- Mass cancels out and angle is unnecessary in CoE, kinematics is a bunch more algebra for zero gain.
