# Physics 1 Lesson 13
## Announcements
- Buoyancy is lab next week, NOT covered in class, only learned in lab, just another force.

## Clicker Questions
- If Paul walks up to the top of a mountain and back down did gravity do any work?
  - No, zero work was done by gravity because your starting and ending potential energy is equal.

## Conservation of Energy
- Kinetic_i + Potential_i = Kinetic_f + Potential_f + Work_external
- #Conservative-Force
  - The work done by a conservative force is independent of the path taken.
  - Gravity will do the same work for a given vertical displacement whether you went up at 1deg or 90deg from normal
- #Non-Conservative-Force
  - The work done by a non-conservative force is dependent on the path taken. Cannot be described by potentials. Must be dealt with as an external force.
  - Friction on a carpet, the shorter the path the less energy lost.

- Could paul lift dumbbells to eequal the power of the tour de france? No he would die, but your physics professor doesn't dope.
