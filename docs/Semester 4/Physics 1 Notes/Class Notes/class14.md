# Physics 1 Lesson 14
## Announcements
- HW due Wednesday involving CoE and momentum
- Buoyancy is in chapter 14 if you need help

## Clicker Questions
- Do you want an airbag to apply a big force over a small time? or vice versa?
  - You want the time to be as long as possible, causing the least damage to your organs as they hit a brick wall in your body
  - The car is built to crumple slowly, the engine is built to move downward, the airbag is built to slowly stop you, and the seatbelt is built to stretch.
- Who is facing the worse headache? Item lands on Alex head and bounces off at same speed as before, item lands on Patrick's head and stays still.
  - Alex gets hurt worse because the change in momentum is TWICE as much
  - 
## Sled Jump
- Spring at top of hill point Z is compressed point A is relaxed (4m apart).
- Radius of curvature of hill is 100m
- jump is 20m above bottom of curve
- landing is 20m below bottom of curve
  - At point Z
    - $$PE_S=\frac{1}{2}k\cdot 4[m]^2$$
    - $$PE_G=mg\cdot 120[m]$$
    - $$KE=0$$
  - At point A
    - $$PE_S=0$$
    - $$PE_G=mg\cdot 120[m]$$
    - $$KE=\frac{1}{2}mv_A^2$$
  - At point B
    - $$PE_S=0$$
    - $$PE_G=mg\cdot 20[m]$$
    - $$KE=\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2$$
  - At point C
    - $$PE_S=0$$
    - $$PE_G=0$$
    - $$KE=\frac{1}{2}mv_C^2$$
- now consider little sister mass is 800kg, at point B she's moving 50m/s, find the spring constant for the spring
  - $$E_B=E_A=E_Z$$
  - At point B
    - $$PE_G=800\cdot10\cdot20=160000J$$
    - $$KE=\frac{1}{2}\cdot800\cdot50^2=1000000J$$
    - $$E_B=160000+1000000=1160000J$$
  - At point Z
    - $$PE_G=800\cdot10\cdot120=960000$$
    - $$PE_S=\frac{1}{2}\cdot16\cdot k=E_Z-PE_G=1160000-960000=200000$$
    - $$k=25000[N/m]$$
- Magnitude of the normal force?
  - $$F=ma=800\cdot\frac{50^2}{100}=20000$$
  - $$F=mg=800\cdot10=8000$$
  - therefore the total normal force is
  - $$20000+8000=28000 \text{up}$$

## Impulse
- To change momentum you need a force OVER a time
- Instead of the exact total force over infinitesimally small time, we can just average
- $$\vec{I}=\vec{F_avg}t$$
- Climbing rope is stretchy because it increases the time over which your momentum changes
