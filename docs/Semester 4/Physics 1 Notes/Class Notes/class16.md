# Physics 1 Lesson 16
## Announcements
- Lab is on Collisions
- homework is conservation of energy, momentum, and center of mass
- exam is next week during lab
- quiz #2 is online from wed night to fri night THIS week
- question 6 on the homework is fairly difficult and lengthy

## Clicker Questions
- what is the arc length traveled at radius = 4 over 43deg?
  - 45deg is pi/4 radians, theta=s/r, pi*4/4=s=pi so pretty close to 3

## Center of Mass
- Rotation is completely separate from translational kinematics

## Rotation
- There's an infinite number of speeds on a rotating disk depending on how far from the center you are
- 2pi radians is the circumference over the radius. multiply by radius to get circumference
  - therefore, theta is the arc length to radius ratio
- Angular velocity and acceleration point in the direction of your right thumb if you curl your fingers in the direction of rotation.
