- Quiz tonight

## Clicker Questions
- A wheel makes 5 complete rotations, how much angular displacement has it gone through?
  - 10pi, not 0, because the wheel DID turn and the angle did not reset to 0 after a single revolution
- Where is centripetal acceleration the greatest?
  - On the circumference, centripetal acceleration is V^2/R, but V=WR, so a=w^2R

## Angular Kinematics 
- Just use the same kinematics with constant acceleration, reminder the speed is in rad/s NOT revs/min
- circumference / radius = radians
