## Announcements
- **SKIPPING LAB 8**
- MC avg was 5.5
- Q11 avg was 8 or 7
- Q12 avg was 7 or 8
- Q13 avg was 4
- given the situation he'll add a point or two back into the Q13
- class average was 24/40
- std dev was 6 or 7, meaning i was only around 1std dev away from peak
- median was 26
- mode was 28
- only two people got 39 or 40
- give corrections to TA

## Clicker Questions
- Hoop vs. Cylinder rolling down a hill which wins?
  - Even with equal mass, the cylinder wins because its mass is closer to its center of mass, i.e lower moment of inertia.
  - How about a box with no friction?
    - Box wins without contest because it doesn't convert ANY energy into rotational, and it all can be converted to kinetic.
- Bean soup vs broth cans, who wins?
  - Broth wins because it doesn't absorb any energy, whereas the entire soup must rotate alongside the can.

## Rotational Kinetic Energy
- Ke is 1/2mv^2 but rotational variables need different quantities
- #Rotational-Kinetic-Energy
  - $$KE_{rot}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$$
    - Where I is the moment of inertia and omega is the rotational velocity.

## Torque
- Torque is I*alpha
- On a disc rolling down a ramp, the frictional force and normal force create a torque on the center of mass.
- This gives you an alpha value?
