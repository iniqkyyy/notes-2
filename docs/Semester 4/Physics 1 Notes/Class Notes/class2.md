## Class
- for car up/downhill problem help
  - car going up and car going down hill at different speeds
  - what is the average speed of the car
  - spent far longer going up than going down
  - going to be lower than the average of the two numbers
- car traveling down a ramp, when does its instantaneous speed equal its average speed?
- average v occurs halfway through time, and car spends more time at the top of the track so its before the halfway point
- $$\Delta x, \vec{V}(t)=\frac{d\vec x}{dt}, \vec{a}(t)=\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}=\frac{d^2\vec{x}}{t^2}$$
- derivative of acceleration is jerk, then snap, crackle, and pop (literally)
- $$v_{init}+\frac{dv}{dt}t=v_{final}$$
- dv/dt IS acceleration, multiplying by t gives you a velocity gained during time t
- $$v_{init}+at=v_{final}$$
- if velocity changes like this, then position changes like:
- $$\Delta x=v_it+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
- with no a
- $$\Delta x=v_it+\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\Delta v}{t})t$$
- elimiating time
- $$v_f^2=v_i^2+2a\Delta x$$
- eliminating vf
- $$\Delta x=v_it+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
- taking integrals are doing derivatives backwards, just accept the formula and move on for now, learn in Calc 2
- $$\bar{v}=v_f-v_i$$
- these equations are the 4 kinematic equations, with one unknown eliminated, but ALL require a constant acceleration
- 4 equations you can solve for 4 unknowns, but those equations require them to be different equations
- we only used 2 equations to make the others, so we can only solve for 2 unknowns
- **this is called One-Dimensional Motion**
- girl on slope passed two brothers, first one at 2m/s second, after 10 seconds, at 10m/s
- make a table of:
  - $$\Delta x=d, \ \ \ v_0=2m/s, \ \ \ v_f=10m/s, \ \ \ a=?, \ \ \ t=10s$$
  - easy to then find your unknowns using kinematic equations
- explained Free Fall (check dict)
