# Physics 1 Lesson 20
## Announcements 
- Lab is conservation of angular momentum and energy
- Homework handouts are highly recommended
- Lab is the last lab for a while

## Clicker Questions
- Who was important to our understanding of planetary motion?
  - Ptolemy Copernicus Kepler Brahe and Galileo

## Line of Action
- #Line-of-Action
  - The line of the force tangent to the radius of the object determines its angular acceleration. If you pull on a spool at an angle above and to the side, you can slide it without rolling it.

## Gravity
- #Gravity
  - $$F_{grav}=-G\frac{M_1M_2}{R^2}\vec{r}$$
    - Where G is 6.67E-11 with units to convert kg^2/m^2 to N
    - Negative indicating an attractive force, directed in r-hat indicating towards each other.
  - g (the 10m/s^2) is therefore GM/r^2 = ~10
