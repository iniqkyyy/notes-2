# Physics 1 Lesson 21
## Announcements
- Barely doing chapter 14, chapter 13 is basically done, chapter 15 is oscillations and we will be focused on that

## Gravity
- #Gravitational-Field
  - $$\vec{g}=\frac{\vec{F}}{m}=-G\frac{M}{r^2}\hat{r}$$
- #Gravitational-Potential
  - $$=V_g=-\frac{GM}{r}$$
- #Gravitational-Potential-Energy
  - $$E=mgh=-\frac{GMm}{r}$$
- Escape velocity is the speed you'd be going starting at 0 potential energy and running into earth due to only its gravitational pull.
- Tips for the homework:
  - If you tunnel halfway to the center of the earth, your local "g" would be related to only the mass of that portion of the earth, and volume is related to the radius cubed, you'd be reducing mass, and therefore g, by 1/8th

## Density
- The earth's upper mantle is around the same density as the moon, if the moon was formed from something like mars hitting the earth and knocking pieces off, that makes sense.
- Gasses are compressible, liquids are not, but both are fluids
- #Pressure
  - Measured in Pascals which is Newtons per meter^2
- We are a bag of incompressible liquid so the force from all psi around us cancels out and we feel nothing
