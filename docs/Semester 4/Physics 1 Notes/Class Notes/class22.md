## Clicker Questions
- A mass 2kg on a spring k=72 is pulled up 10cm then thrown down at 0.3m/s
  - Solving w=6, we can see that plugging into position and velocity gives us
    - $$0.1[m]=X_{max}\cos(\Theta)$$
    - $$0.3[rad/s]=6X_{max}\sin(\Theta)$$
  - Now divide them
    - $$\frac{0.3}{0.1}=\frac{6X_{max}\sin(\Theta)}{X_{max}\cos(\Theta)}$$
  - Combine trig and cancel X_max
    - $$\Theta=\arctan(3/6)$$
  - Plug in to solve for X_max

## Oscillation
- #Period
  - $$\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$
  - Where, on a spring, omega is
    - $$\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$
    - Where k=spring constant and m=mass of object
  - Where, on a simple pendulum, omega is
    - $$\sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}$$
    - Where g=gravity acceleration, and R is the length of the arm
- #Simple-Harmonic-Motion
  - Any time a system has a restoring force:
  - $$\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}+\omega^2x(t)=0$$
  - Where x(t) is
    - $$x(t)=A\cos(\omega t+\Theta)$$
    - $$x'(t)=-\omega A\sin(\omega t+\Theta)$$
    - $$x''(t)=-\omega^2A\cos(\omega t+\Theta)$$
    - Where A is the amplitude, or maximum position
  - This shows that where the angular acceleration is max is where the position is lowest (sign is flipped), and angular velocity is the highest when position is 0.
  - Note that the theta is the phase angle.
