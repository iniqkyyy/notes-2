# Physics 1 Lesson 3
- SPS students of physics society first meet and greet today
  - homework help 
  - astronomy trips
  - make robots/arduinos
  - NASA internships
  - conferences 
  - meeting today @ barnard atrium second floor w/ pizza and games 5:10pm
## Announcements
- Holography show!!
  - second floor barnard 215 shutting down this weekend
- Pre-lab is LONG for next week, have to go through the whole Uncertainty section
  - either 220 or 137 AJM for lab
## Class
- clicker question 1
  - red ball thrown up at 30m/s off cliff, blue ball 30m/s down
  - land at the same time?
  - yes, the red ball thrown up will return to the starting position with equal velocity downwards rather than up
- **EQUATION SHEET MADE BY YOU ON ONE SIDE OF SHEET OF PAPER**
- clicker question 2
  - what vector represents acceleration down a hill?
  - well if acceleration is just the change in velocity over time, and velocity follows the slope of the hill, then acceleration is pointing in the direction of the slope of the hill, NOT down through gravity
- acceleration is only straight down and equal to gravity (9.8m/s) IF and only IF the object is in free fall
- boat question
  - a boat is cruising at 3.0m/s, at time t=0, the boat begins accelerating with a=1.6m/s^2
  - how far will the boat have traveled 10 seconds later?
  - use table! [[Physics 1 Notes/dict.md]] #Constant-Acceleration-Formulas
    - $$\Delta x = d, v_{0x}=3m/s, v_{fi}=?, a=1.6m/s^2, t=10$$
    - want to find d? which formula has no v_final
    - $$\Delta x=3\cdot10+\frac{1}{2}1.6\cdot 10^2=110m$$
- Usain Bolt question
  - in 100m dash, usain bolt reached top speed of 44.72km/h over 50m, what is his avg acceleration?
  - use table! [[Physics 1 Notes/dict.md]]
    - $$\Delta{x}=50m, v_{0x}=0, v_{fx}=44.72km/hr=12.4m/s, a_x=a, t=t$$
    - want to find a? find which formula has no time
    - $$\frac{v_{fx}^2-v_{ix}^2}{2\Delta x}=a$$
    - $$a=\frac{150-0}{100}=1.5m/s^2$$
- all ODD numbered problems, questions, and checkpoints have answers in the back of the textbook
