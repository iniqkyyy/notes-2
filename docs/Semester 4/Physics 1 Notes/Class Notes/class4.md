# Physics 1 Lesson 4
## Announcements
- prelab for lab 2 is LONG and in the room across the hall 137 not 138 AJMJonhson
## 2D Kinematics
- A is 100m long at 45deg above x-axis, B is 200m at 60deg below -x
- geometrically:
  - slide B tail to tip of A, connect A tail to B tip
- algebraically:
  - $$A_x=A\cos{45\deg}=71m\ \ \& \ \ A_y=A\sin{45\deg}=71m$$
  - $$B_x=B\cos{45\deg}=-100m\ \ \& \ \ B_y=B\sin{45\deg}=-173m$$
  - $$R=(A_x+B_x, A_y, B_y)$$
  - $$\vec{R}\angle=\tan^{-1}\frac{R_y}{R_x}$$
  - $$|\vec{R}|=\sqrt{R_x^2+R_y^2}$$
## Unit Vectors
- Define vectors in each direction along cartesian coordinates having 1 "unit" of magnitude, i=x-axis, j=y-axis, k=z-axis.
- two units in the x direction and three in the y direction
  - $$\vec{R}=2\hat{i}+3\hat{i}$$
  - could sometimes be written with x hat y hat
  - $$\vec{R}=2\hat{x}+3\hat{y}$$
  - example
- this is #Vector-Addition see dictionary
  - $$\vec{A}=3\hat{i}+6\hat{j} \ \ \& \ \ \vec{B}=3\hat{i}-4\hat{j}$$
  - $$\vec{C}=\vec{A}+\vec{B}$$
  - $$\vec{C}=(3+3)\hat{i}+(6-4)\hat{j}=6\hat{i}+2\hat{j}$$
  - again the magnitude and angle are sqrt(A^2+B^2) and tan^-1(B/A) respectively
## 1D Kinematics
- Ice Climber Story Alex
  - climbing down ice mountain with 60m rope, dropped rock off cliff, how long should the rock take to drop until your rope isn't long enough?
  - $$\Delta{y}=v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
  - $$\Delta{y}=0t + 5t^2$$
  - $$t=\sqrt{12}\approx 3.5$$
## 2D Kinematics
- just make the table twice with x components and y components
- an object thrown will experience a constant change in vertical velocity, and no change in horizontal velocity ignoring air resistance
- projectile motion will always have a 9.8m/s^2 acceleration downwards
- clicker question
  - Shoot a bullet out of a gun and drop a bullet from the same height, which one hits the ground first?
  - BOTH AT SAME TIME EQUAL ACCELERATION DOWN
- moving car shooting something straight up will catch it at constant velocity (no acceleration) (impractical given real-world)
