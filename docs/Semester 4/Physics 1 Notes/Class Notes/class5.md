## Clicker Questions
- baseball hit into home run, how does the magnitude of its velocity change over the flight?
  - decreases until peak, then increases until landing
- distance a rock has fallen, 1 second after being released?
  - $$\Delta{y}=0*1+\frac{1}{2}9.8*1^2=4.9m$$
- ball thrown from ground level to a building level, delta y is what height?
  - the height of the building. not the peak height, not the height from peak to building, just the building height
## Projectile Motion
- ignore air resistance
- make a table of known values 
- the velocity in the x-direction will alyways be the same, and the acceleration of the x direction will always be 0
- the horizontal and vertical time will be linked, usually equal
- always make a #Kinematics-Table

|Horizontal|Vertical|
|---|---|
|$$\Delta{x}$$|$$\Delta{y}$$|
|$$V_{0x}=V_{fx}$$|$$V_{0y}$$|
|$$V_{fx}=V_{0x}$$|$$V_{fy}$$|
|$$a_x=0$$|$$a_y$$|
|$$t$$|$$t$$|

- Problem Ch4#38
  - golf ball is struck at ground level, here's a graph of its speed (velocity magnitude) over time
  - we know v_0x because at the apex it is purely horizontal and horizontal velocity never changes

|Horizontal|Vertical|
|---|---|
|$$\Delta{x}=d$$|$$\Delta{y}=h$$|
|$$V_{0x}=19m/s$$|$$V_{0y}=\sqrt{31^2-19^2}$$|
|$$V_{fx}=19m/s$$|$$V_{fy}=0$$|
|$$a_x=0$$|$$a_y=-10m/s^2$$|
|$$t=5$$|$$t=5/2=2.5$$|

  - to find d it's just vx*t = 95m
  - to find V_0y we can take the total velocity magnitude and do pythagoras theorem with V_0x
  - to find h we need half time since it's the peak value
  - finding h use #Constant-Acceleration-Formulas
- remember that all vector x/y components are just right triangles

- Problem 2!
  - An ugly giant rolls a billiard ball with uniform velocity 30m/s across the top of his desk. The ball rolls off the edge of the desk and lands on the floor 120m from the edge. How high is the table?
  - let's fill out a table woohoo
  
|Horizontal|Vertical|
|---|---|
|$$\Delta{x}=120m$$|$$\Delta{y}=h$$|
|$$V_{0x}=30m/s$$|$$V_{0y}=0$$|
|$$V_{fx}=30m/s$$|$$V_{fy}=?$$|
|$$a_x=0m/s^2$$|$$a_y=-10m/s^2$$|
|$$t=4$$|$$t=4$$|

  - time = dist/vel so 120/30=4s
  - solve for h using #Constant-Acceleration-Formulas
    - $$\Delta{y}=v_{0y}t+\frac{1}{2}at^2=-80m$$
    - negative is because we chose positive down on a falling question but height is absolute so 80m
### Gallileo
- noticed that each second that an object is falling, its distance falling takes on the appearance of (1/2*a) times an odd number
## Equations
- We make our own equation sheet. Showcase knowledge of what equations and examples you need.
- Single sheet of whatever you want.
## Circular Motion
- #Uniform-Circular-Motion 
  - An object rotating around a circle at a constant speed AND its path is exactly circular.
  - Period is the circumference over speed
    - $$T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}$$
  - Frequency is 1/period
    - $$f=\frac{1}{T}$$
- #Centripetal-Acceleration
  - An object in #Uniform-Circular-Motion will experience a constant acceleration towards the center.
    - $$|\vec{a_{centripetal}}|=\frac{v_{tangential}^2}{r}$$
  - This formula is DIFFICULT to derive, so just try to remember it. It will be extremely important.
  - Somewhat explanation, if you doubled the speed around the track, the acceleration quadruples. If you halved the radius you still get a different delta velocity, specifically doubled.
