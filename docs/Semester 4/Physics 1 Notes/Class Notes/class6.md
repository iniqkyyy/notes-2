## iClicker
- white car 20m/s 40m/s^2 vs black car 40m/s 20m/s^2 which is currently passing?
  - black: it is CURRENTLY moving faster

## Questions
- Penguin starts at rest, begins running, then slides, then down a slope, and back up a wall
  - acceleration when on hill, there is a component that is tangential AND a centripetal acceleration!
  - total acceleration is at an angle between tangent and center to the hill
  - even at the base of the valley you are still accelerating in the turn, purely tangential acceleration
- Object falling into snow
  - velocity down, acceleration up
  - what are the forces? gravitational force points down, force from snow is opposite but is it bigger smaller or equal?

## Types of Acceleration
- Speeding up (same direction as velocity)
- Slowing down (opposite direction as velocity)
- Centripetal (turning)

## Newton's Laws
- Forces *cause* Kinematics
- more like facts of life instead of laws, based on observation
- build using newton's laws, but correct it with relativistic laws in software
- A block sliding down a hill (frictionless) has a gravitational #Force straight down, and a #Normal-Force perpendicular to the hill. These vectors' #Net-Force is non-zero in the direction of the decline of the hill.
- Net force is directly related to the #Acceleration of the object, NOT velocity.

## Definitions
- #Force
  - is the Push and Pull of an object. A force is a Vector with a magnitude and direction.
- #Newtons
  - is the measurement of #Force, about the weight force of a small apple, also known as a kg-m/s^2
- #Contact-Force
  - #Pushes
    - Friction, Normal.
  - #Pulls
    - Tension
- #Non-Contact-Force
  - The forces exerted by gravity, magnets, and electrostatic.
- #Freebody-Diagram
  - Drawing all #Force vectors acting on your object. Summing these gives you a #Net-Force.
- #Net-Force
  - The sum of all #Force vectors on an object, resulting in an acceleration if non-zero.
