# Physics 1 Lesson 7

- %^%^complementary angles, supplementary angles, and opposite interior angles are important, look this up later!


## Announcements
- HW3 due today sep 10th
- HW4 due Wed Sep 17th
- for kinematics USE A TABLE!
- for forces USE A FREE-BODY DIAGRAM!

## Clicker Questions
- Dropping an object from a hot air balloon traveling at a constant velocity left and down, the object will land with the baloon in which position?
  - horizontal velocities will never change therefore the balloon will be directly overhead at all times
- When a string is spinning a ball from above, the center of the circle is where?
  - THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCLE **NOT** THE CONNECTION POINT OF THE STRING

## Example Problems
- a block connected to two ropes held up at an angle against a wall, forces acting on the block?
  - gravity, tension from rope1, tension from rope2

## Free-Body Diagramming
- IMPORTANT
- $$|\vec{F}|_{A,B}=|\vec{F}|_{B,A}$$
- BUT the directions are exactly opposite
- Re-translated Newton's Law
  - "Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by the forces impressed."

## Mass
- Means how much "stuff".
- MKS = mass kilogramme second, SI units basically
- $$N=kg\frac{m}{s^2}$$
- F=MA F=MA F=MA F=MA F=MA F=MA F=MA F=MA F=MA

## Gravitational Force
- $$F_g=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
- where G~6.67E-11
