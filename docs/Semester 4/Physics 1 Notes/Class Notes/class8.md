## Clicker Questions
- Block sliding down a ramp, y-axis is normal to the ramp, what is the net force in the x-direction?
  - $$|W_{E,b}\sin{\theta}|$$
  - the angle of incline of the ramp is equal to the angle of the force triangle from weight
- Which vehicle pushes harder during the crash? Truck or car?
  - Both push the same, N3L
- Coke can on a table, free body diagrams?
  - Can's diagram has a weight and normal force that HAPPEN to be equal to eachother BECAUSE of N2L and no acceleration
  - IF THIS WERE BECAUSE OF N3L, THEN IF THE SYSTEM BEGINS ACCELERATING THE CAN WOULD STAY IN THE SAME PLACE
- Rocket during takeoff what is pushing on the rocket?
  - Exhaust flow is pushing against the rocket propelling them out like tiny little medicine balls

## N2L
- 5kg mass pushed 4m/s^2 with 100N of force, what is net force?
  - $$F_{net}=ma=5*4=20N$$
  - therefore there must be an 80N force against the movement of the object
- 15kg mass pulled 100N upwards 37deg from x, friction is 50N left of x
  - upward force
    - $$N-W+T\sin{\theta}=ma$$
  - right force
    - $$T\cos{\theta}-f=ma_x$$

## N3L
- All forces on an object experience an equal and opposite force.
  - $$F_{A,B}=-F_{B,A}$$
- If you step off a building and you fall towards the earth
  - $$a_{Paul}=\frac{W_{Earth, Paul}}{m_{Paul}}$$
  - isn't there a reverse?
  - $$a_{Earth}=\frac{W_{Paul, Earth}}{m_{Earth}}$$
  - yes but because the earth is so massive, it doesn't accelerate much
  - BUT they experience the same forces
- Force pairs like the 3rd law show up in DIFFERENT free-body diagrams, never in the same.
- Holy shit what a revelation...

## Liquid Nitrogen Demo (Actually Carbon Dioxide)
- On a cart blowing fire extinguisher will accelerate away from flow

## Free-Body Diagrams Practice
- Draw a point by itself
- Draw all of the forces acting on the mass
  - Weight, Normal, Tension, Push/Pull, Friction
- Use subscripts!!!
- Write x and y F=ma
- Do algebra!
