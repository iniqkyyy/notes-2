# Physics 1 Lesson 9
## Announcements
- do hw5 before exam
- hw4 due tonight

## Clicker Questions
- Placing a block on a crate, what happens?
  - Increases the normal force of the floor on the crate.

## Friction
- #Static-Friction
  - No surface motion, harder to calculate.
- #Kinetic-Friction
  - Relative motion of surfaces, easier to calculate.
  - $$f_k=\mu_mN$$
- Friction force is proportional to normal force, i.e linearly related to the mass of hte object
- Friction is not related to surface area either.
- man im checked out rn
