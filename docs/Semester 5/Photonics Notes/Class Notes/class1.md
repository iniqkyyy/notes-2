# Metrology Lesson 1
- Overview material
- Calibration is always first priority
- Next is material sepcs such as IoR, transmission/reflectance, specular/diffuse, contrast, uniformity, size, etc.
- Imaginary part of the refractive index is related to the absorptivity, which is inversely related to emissivity for blackbodies.
- refractiveindex.info cool to see material IoR
- specular reflection = smooth
- rough surface = diffuse reflection
- heterogenous inside = specular reflection but diffuse transmission
- rough everywhere = diffuse reflection and transmission
- Ronchi Rulings are repeating patterns on glass/mirrored surfaces like a diffraction grating
- USAF 1951 target is a collection of Ronchi Rulings
- PTFE (Spectralon)
  - Common as relative calibration targets
  - As near perfect diffuse reflector as possible
  - Used for calibration
- #Radiance
  - W/m^2*sr
  - $$L=\frac{P}{\Omega A}$$
  - sr is the solid angle relative to source vs receiver FOV
- #Luminance
  - L_V in lm/m^2*sr
  - replaces watts with lumens
  - lumens are relative to human visual response, adapted for night/day viewing
  - candella is lumen/sr already so it could also be candella/m^2
- Moire' Patterns
- Relies on Ronchi rulings to generate patterns similar to those from traditional interferograms
