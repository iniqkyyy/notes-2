# Metrology Lesson 2
- Effective focal length = from principal plane.
- Back focal length = from FINAL optical surface.
- Principal planes
  - thick lenses (and systems) have two principal planes front and back
- EFL important for the F/#
- BFL important for opto-mechanical
- flange focal length is just an important distance relative to attacahing things together
- Aperture Stop
  - smallest thing light goes through in an optical system
- Entrance pupil
  - Go to object space and ray trace the aperture stop to find the magnification and therefore the "light collection size" of the system
- F/#
  - EFL/Diameter_EP
- With no iris, might need clear aperture
- Clear aperture usually < 95% of the actual lens diameter, just an effective "size" of the lens while mounted and accounting for edge error
- FOV
  - Maximum incidence angle which results in image formation
- Numerical aperture
  - $$NA=n\sin(\theta_{hOut})=\frac{n}{2F/\#}$$
- Depth of Focus
  - Range of distances in the z-axis around the focal plane at which the spot size is diffraction limited
  - Basically just an area around the focal plane where you aren't that unfocused because of diffraction
- Airy Disk
  - $$D_{Airy}=\frac{\lambda}{2NA}$$
