# Metrology Lesson 4
- Wavefront Sensors
- Shack Hartmann
- tiny lenses followed by even smaller pixels to collect light
- the local slope of each wavefront segment will determine where the light gets focused by the lenslet
- can use just four pixels and use the proportion of power on each pixel to determine the slope
- pros
  - fast alignment
  - high temporal resolution
- cons
  - low spatial resolution
  - dynamic range depends on tilt
    - dynamic range is the difference between max and min local slopes
- Pyramid WFS
- splits light into four images, if no aberrations then they all match
- pros
  - more sensitive than shack hartmann, reduced noise on the CCD pixels (further away so no cross-talk)
  - reduced airy disk diameter
- cons
  - requires mechanical movement
- Roddier test (wavefront curvature sensing)
- still lenslet array
- mechanically move the detector backwards, taking images before and after the focal plane of the lenslet
- pros
  - high sensitivity to low-order aberrations
  - tunable gain for varying intensity sources
- cons
  - slow measurements
  - low sensitivity to high-order aberrations
- interferometer (mach-zehnder)
  - split beam through beam splitter, send through two lenses, keep one unchanged, send the other through a pinhole at the focal plane
  - interfference pattern shows aberrations
- pros
  - high spatial and temporal resolution
- cons
  - slow alignment
  - large footprint
  - vibration sensitive
- reading interferograms
  - like reading a topographical map
  - no way to know which way is up or down, therefore phase shift becomes critical
  - change phase to find what is peak and what is valley
  - with interferometry we're looking at phase first, then interference
  - a perfect wavefront with no aberrations would just be one color
- optical power = how fast/strong something focuses light, or similar
