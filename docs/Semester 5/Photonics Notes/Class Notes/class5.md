# Metrology Lesson 5
- Interferometers
- test arm and refernce arm are the whole idea
- split beam, recombine, observe interference
- fizeau interferometers split the beam with a partial reflection and a true reflection, with spatial re-alignment done somehow at the end
  - high-quality optic
  - less vibration sensitive
  - reference can be the mirror or the glass
  - pros
    - self-referencing, laser/thermal stability
    - high spatial resolution
    - simple
  - cons
    - vibration sensitivity
    - curvature limits
    - contrast tuning (power inefficient)
    - spurious fringes
- shearing interferometers have one piece of glass that reflects twice into the eye piece
  - typically only used for collimation
  - pros
    - simple
    - self-referencing
    - common path (vibration insensitivity)
  - cons
    - limited use
    - mainly qualitative
    - low dynamic range
- twyman green interferometers
  - just a michelson but you have a lens + mirror on one arm, you can do planar and spherical wavefronts
  - not fun to set up
- all of this falls under the umbrella of optical coherence tomography
