# Metrology Lesson 6
- mach-zehnder interferometer
  - same split and two arms, but recombined in both a "positive" and "negative" image (1pi phase shift)
  - pros
    - flexible setup
    - tunable contrast
    - captures all output power
  - cons
    - extremely sensitive to environment
    - high coherence requirement (need to fix OPD on the reference arm)
- sagnac
  - split but go in a loop
  - only when the system is rotating, the photons have angular momentum, which causes phase shift
  - fiber can be used to increase size of the loop, which will increase sensitivity to rotation
  - pros
    - extremely stable
  - cons
    - extremely limited to only rotation detection
- point diffraction
  - semi-transparent element with pinhole (smaller than airy disk), making two different "images"
  - moving the lens in front can "scan" the wavefront along the z-axis
  - pros
    - low environmental sensitivity
    - no refernce surface
    - small footprint
  - cons
    - hard to tune fringe contrast
- fabry-perot etalon
  - collimate source -> etalon cavity reflects light many times -> focused -> airy disk interferogram
  - distance between fringes determines the wavelength allowed to propogate
  - $$nd\cos({\theta})=\frac{m\lambda}{2}$$
  - Finesse determines the sharpness
  - Coefficient of Finesse
    - $$\frac{4r}{(1-r)^2}$$
  - Free-Spectral Range
    - $$FSR=\frac{\lambda^2}{2nd}$$
  - Finesse
    - $$\mathcal{F}=\frac{\pi\sqrt{F}}{2}=\frac{\pi\sqrt{r}}{1-r}=\frac{FSR}{\Delta\lambda}$$
