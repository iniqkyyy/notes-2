- What has been the love of your life so far?
  - Since the age of 3, I have loved electronics. I would sit at home on the floor reverse engineering toys, I would be fascinated at the sight of a television and how it worked. I had a circuit kit for children that I completed every project multiple times. I have always been captivated by technology and "how things work". The black box analogy applies perfectly to this; when you first learn something, to be proficient enough to work with it you focus solely on two things, the input and the output. When you ignore the inner mechanisms of the metaphorical "black box" and only focus on the input and output, you can then easily understand how to do most things, only when you become curious about the tool that you have been using without understanding can you then begin to experiment: find patterns in what inputs produce what outputs, explore slightly into what makes the black box work. Only when you begin to explore this obscured "thing" will it begin to fade, slowly, from a opaque black box to a more and more transparent machine that you will eventually fully understand.

  - "To all the people whose feelings got hurt by the Burn Book, I'm really sorry"
  - Cady goes around the room, first finding Jessica Lopez and complimenting her dress.
  - Cady goes up on stage to accept a "trophy" but instead apologizes to her peers and compliments everyone's appearances, going as far as to break apart her "trophy" and throw the broken pieces to everyone to signify that everyone is a winner in their own right.

## Ending
