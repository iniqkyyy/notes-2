## Daily Freewrite 
- What's the hardest you ever worked?
  - I guess working on myself to meet my partners expectations to eventually get through to them and get them help to help themselves. I really love Silas, but they have always had some negative tendencies. I like to be the person to take care of someone and take all of their baggage and handle it myself, but Silas did take advantage of that. I conciously chose to live in a toxic relationship because I knew that it wasn't them, I knew that there was a person worthy of love inside of them. I did eventually get them the help they needed and watching them blossom is the most amazing thing I will ever get to personally witness. They've been talking about feeling bad and apologizing for their actions recently and I'm excited about that. I don't put myself down or feel like I deserve to be treated poorly, I just feel like Silas deserves to be treated better than they have been throughout their life. I think I'm succeeding in that aspect. While it takes a toll on my mental health I hope that in the long run it is worth it. I think it will be, I'm very hopefully and glass-half-full. The quick red fox jumped over the lazy yellow dog.
