- How does it feel to have a crush on somebody?
  - Aching. Longing. Obsessive. I'm not sure what words to use to describe the feeling, I haven't felt many crushes but I have observed many others' experiences. I watch people, I don't "act" people. I don't feel as  though I am connected to reality so much as I am witnessing it and what is around me. Crushes feel like an intense longing desire, one that feels like it will never be reciprocated. Something that you can't have, a forbidden ice cream flavor. My understanding is that most crushes end when reciprocated. Crushes don't lead to relationships, crushes lead to flings. A connection, a spark, that *both* parties feel at the same time, is what leads to relationships. A mutual "crush", a sense of togetherness, a feeling of completion. This is what finding someone you love is like. Wanting what you cannot have, longing for someone you know nothing about, the butterflies in your stomach when you see them. These are all interpretations of lust, not love. The feeling of love is like the feeling of being content. You don't know what it was about it, nothing sparked how you feel, you just felt "good". They *made* you feel good.
