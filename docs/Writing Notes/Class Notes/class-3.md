    - Hi grandma! That was so awesome to read about your hip replacement!! I'm so glad all of those traumatic experiences are behind you now. Speaking of traumatic, I haven't been having the best luck recently. About 30 minutes ago, the barista at the coffee shop dropped a drink on my laptop and my big paper didn't save so now I have nothing to turn in tomorrow. Pretty bummed about that. I hope everything is going better for you! Love, Nick.

    - Hello, my name is Nicholas Bettencourt. Today, January 25th 2024, at around 12:05PM, I was in your coffee shop on ABC street and a barista by the name of Kathy Bomgardner tripped and spilled the drink she was carrying on my laptop and me. I have since lost many of my personal photos and documents, my legs are red with burns, and this entire siuation has caused me immense emotional and physical distress. I would love to get in contact with a representative to talk about some sort of financial compensation for my lost things and potential medical bills. Please respond to me via email (myemail@email.com) or call me at (406-123-4567). Looking forward to a response, Nicholas Bettencourt.

- Prompt: Either the best gift you've ever received, or best gift given.
    ```
    Last Christmas, 2023, I had mentioned my desire to get into computer engineering and my fleeting interest in breadboard technology. My parents went above and beyond in that regard and purchased me the most amazing all-in-one kit for learning how to create anything with a breadboard and code its execution. I have since nearly completing all learning modules in this kit and I have fallen in love with this whole new world I experienced. So far the most interesting thing about this gift has been learning exactly how ports on a circuit board are encoded and how to access that with cpp code. I'm excited to make a practical application of all of what I've learned and to go into welding theory as one of my electives to learn how to make permanent fixtures instead of proof-of-concept products that wouldn't work in application since things can fall apart. The technology of these things was always shrouded in mystery to me and it has been a joy learning about it.
