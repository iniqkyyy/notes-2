## Daily Freewrite 
- Memorable birthday, good or bad!
    - My partner Silas's 19th? birthday was extremely memorable. We had flown down to Oklahoma to see his family and friends and have a big get-together since he'd been gone for an entire year by that point. We rented out a community center, made food for everyone, set the date months in advance, RSVP, the whole nine yards. Day comes and Silas's mom is fighting with him, everyone is either late or not responding, children are running around making a whole mess, the burgers aren't getting cooked, we forgot buns from the store that was 30 minutes away, and to top it all off Silas is having a massive weed-induced panic attack. Silas eventually locked himself in the bathroom, crying and sobbing, while everyone didn't even notice he was gone. Half the people who RSVP'd didn't even show up! I took his brother to go to Walmart 30 minutes away and in that time Silas got even worse. Eventually his mom reluctantly calmed down but the party was completely over anyways and I drove Silas back to the hotel.
