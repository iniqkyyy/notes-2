# Lesson 8

## Class Overview
- 

## Daily Freewrite 
- Write about a time you had a crazy stroke of luck.
  - I honestly cannot think of a time I was lucky. I probably am lucky in my lack of accidents throughout my life. I have never been stung by a bee, I've never broken a bone, the worst pain that I have ever experienced was getting the wind knocked out of me. I have never experienced heartbreak, the only truly horrific memory I have is my grandfather dying, the other three are alive and well however. When we got our dog Rosie, she was very sick and nearly died, she is still alive now after nine? years. I guess my luck has trickled through my life instead of coming all at one moment. I guess in that way I am lucky, but there has never been an "a-ha!" moment that I can recall. Meeting Silas? I'm not certain. The clock is ticking down yet I am still here writing for this prompt. I have run out of things to write about. I am filling the page with empty, non-coherent, thoughts. Thank god it's over.

## Ungrading
- Emphasis on intellectual engagement. Grading also on progress throughout class, where you started vs. where you ended.
- Rikka spends 30-45 (60-90) minutes per paper giving line edits (grammar/question/writing skill)
  - Rikka writes about a page of narrative feedback; what succeeded, what didn't. Also what the paper needs to be an A+.
  - Two "ghost grades" (not important for final grade) A-F grades at bottom of page
    - Content grade
      - Quality of language
    - Mechanics grade
      - Grammar
- Revised papers in final portfolio using her feedback will be the only thing that effects grades.
- There are no recorded grades on D2L, can ask Rikka for feedback on how you're doing.
- Another freewrite but collected.

## Next Paper
- Research paper
- 6 weeks of research and writing
- longest paper
- Workshop on Thursday March 21st, full draft.
  - Long weekend, submitted next Tuesday.
- 5-7 pages PLUS works cited.
- At least four separate sources, at least two from the MSU library databases. 
- MLA class, will give us training and resources on how to cite.
- Writing paper in first person, encouraged to use your own personal experience. (Rikka wants to see why this topic is important)
- Can choose any topic except abortion
  - Rikka cannot turn off her emotions on this topic, so do not write about Roe vs. Wade.
- Write about your topic academically, using peer-reviewed papers.
- **i am respecting rikka more**
- 

## Another Freewrite??
- What topics would you be interested in spending the next six weeks researching and writing about?
    - I'm honestly not very sure. Something to do with video games would be an easy choice.
    - Philosophy! I'm sure of it, this would be super interesting.
    - Linus Torvalds' life? Maybe Terry Davis?
    - Something to do with technology? Maybe the silicon shortages, bitcoin mining?
    - Plastic surgery in Asia, beauty standards in Asia coming from WW2 days of America

## Double Grammar Corner
- #Me-Myself-I
  - people get incorrect everywhere
  - "She asked Anna and [me, myself, I] for the wifi password"
    - answer is "me", because if you remove other people it is: "She asked [me, myself, I] for the wifi password"
  - "massage the conjugation"
  - "myself" can only appear if you have already appeared in the sentence
    - "*I* can buy _myself_ flowers"
    - "*I myself* prefer this"
- #Passive-Voice
  - conjugations of "to be" (is, are, am, will, were, could have, has been, etc.) followed by the past-participle of a verb (jumped, sailed, awoke, etc.)
  - In journalism
    - "Shots *were fired*..."
    - "A car *was abandoned*..."
    - "Mistakes *were made*..."
  - Passive construction
    - "3 jars of cookies *were eaten* by her dog"
  - Active construction
    - "*Her dog* ate 3 jars of cookies"
  - If it is longer and passive then it feels more professional (this is a misconception)

## Ending
- Homework
  - Thursday bring in list of possible topics (1-3)
  - D2L book everyone's and author chapter 21
  - article "Age of Instagram Face" as research example
