# Shitty First Drafts
## Notes While Reading
- No writers are perfect
    - nobody sits down and feels amazing and taltented and writes amazing first drafts
- Be like a child when writing first drafts
    - do not care what it looks like nobody will see it
- Three drafts for three "parts"
    1. Down draft, get the words down
    2. Up draft, fix everything up
    3. Dental draft, check every tooth
## Questions
1. "The fantasy of the uninitiated", the naive ideals of someone who has no clue how much self-loathing and despair a writer may go through to write something. An explanation of how fantasized writing is in media and how difficult it may be in reality.
2. "let myself trust the process-- sort of, more or less" In my head this is referring to her still experiencing bouts of doubt and unease while writing, despite knowing that time after time she has written amazing things. The idea that she can still be worried but know she can do it.
3. Writing a first draft is entirely about the process. The product is, of course, necessary, but getting words down and writing freely is seemingly the most important part of the writing process to her and the people she has associated with. This process, one of complete freedom, is the only way to truly access your mind and write the profound things you see your peers create.
